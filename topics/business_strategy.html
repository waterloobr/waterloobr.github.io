                                        high-quality products at affordable prices. Today, they represent a low-quality
                                        last resort meal. In recent year, the once-undisputed leader in the fast food
                                        industry has faced significant challenges. As consumer preferences shift towards
                                        healthier and more sustainable options, McDonald's must evolve to maintain its

                                    <p>Despite its global reverence for speed, technology, and prestige, Formula 1 has
                                        struggled to gain a firm foothold in the American market. A lack of competition,
                                        a flawed economic model, and the absence of genuine American representation have
                                        all hindered its expansion efforts. This article seeks to explore the key
                                        missteps that have plagued Formula 1's ambitious push into the U.S. market.</p>

                                        through challenges with rising costs, greater regulations and less developed
                                        infrastructure. As major airlines continue to grow, the survival of these
                                        low-cost airlines become dependent on their ability to build partnerships. This

                                        <h4>The War on Big Tech</h4>
                                    </a>
                                    <p>As an era of rapid monopolization spurred by Big Tech begins to boom, efforts
                                        made by governing bodies through antitrust legislation grow more aggressive.
                                        This article explores the idea that despite the honourable intentions in
                                        preventing a monopolistic market, the war on big tech is not as black and white
                                        a conflict as it may initially seem. The deeper you look, the more evident it
                                        becomes that antitrust legislation is less a protective mechanism fighting
                                        against the monopoly power of Big Tech, but rather an economically misguided,
                                        politically motivated and legally conspicuous institution focused too much on
                                        tearing things down and too little on building them back up.</p>

                                        spotlight. Contributing to 57% of global energy consumption, O&G has become the
                                        top sustainability priority for industry professionals to work towards. This
