                                    <p>Dry powder in private equity has swelled since 2013 to almost $3 trillion. With
                                        this record amount of dry powder and recent run-up in asset prices, firms are
                                        eyeing alternative assets to capture uncorrelated returns and diversify their
                                        portfolios. Over the past decade, sport franchise values have skyrocketed and
                                        grown rapidly when compared to nearly every other asset class.</p>

                                        individuals has never been greater. Even testing tools such as security scans
                                        are often inadequate and thus hiring hackers to instead test corporations’
                                        platforms proves to be beneficial. With cybercrimes being very lucrative and
                                        hackers being viewed as technological tools, it is critical to understand what

                                    </a>
                                    <p>As an era of rapid monopolization spurred by Big Tech begins to boom, efforts
                                        made by governing bodies through antitrust legislation grow more aggressive.
                                        This article explores the idea that despite the honourable intentions in
                                        preventing a monopolistic market, the war on big tech is not as black and white
                                        a conflict as it may initially seem. The deeper you look, the more evident it
                                        becomes that antitrust legislation is less a protective mechanism fighting
                                        against the monopoly power of Big Tech, but rather an economically misguided,
                                        politically motivated and legally conspicuous institution focused too much on
                                        tearing things down and too little on building them back up.</p>
