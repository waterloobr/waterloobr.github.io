## file navigation (a work in progress)
Changes will be continually made to make the repository more maintainable as it grows. Currently, the repository organizational structure is as follows: 
.
├── articles                   # termly articles 
│   ├── fall-2020      
│   ├── spring-2020  
├── assets                     
│   ├── img
│       ├── logo               # all article graphics are stored here 
│   |...                       # other styling/js/etc 
├── css                        
├── images                     # icons & pages for interactive view
├── javascript                 
├── regions                    # ? to add desc.
├── topics                     # the 4 WBR article topic pages 
└── index.html,
