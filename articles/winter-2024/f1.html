    <h2>﻿Gridlock: The Pitfalls of F1's Failed Expansion into America</h2>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-10">
    <div class="about-details-cap">
    <p> Formula 1, the pinnacle of motorsport, has long been revered for its blend of speed, technology, and prestige. However, despite its global popularity and iconic status, Formula 1 has encountered numerous challenges in its quest to establish a firm foothold in the American market. From misjudging the transition from Netflix to live viewership, to grappling with a lack of competitiveness and a flawed economic model, F1's expansion efforts in America have been met with significant roadblocks, highlighting the complexities of penetrating one of the world's most diverse and competitive sports markets. Liberty Media’s aggressive attempt to forcefully penetrate the American market can serve as a cautionary tale on entering new markets for other companies. </p>
    <p class="mb-30"><b>The Rise of F1 in America</b></p>
    <div class="details-img">
    <img class="img-fluid mb-15" src="assets/img/winter-2024/articles/budget-airlines/ba-1.svg" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;margin:10px 0px; max-height: 500px">

    <p> Clearly in the past, Formula 1 had encountered formidable challenges in its quest to capture the hearts of American audiences. </p>
    <div class="details-img">
    <img class="img-fluid mb-15" src="assets/img/winter-2024/articles/budget-airlines/ba-2.svg" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;margin:10px 0px; max-height: 500px">
    </div>
    <p> The 2021 season, characterized by a fiercely contested title battle between Red Bull driver Max Verstappen (3x World Champion) and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton (7x World Champion), served as a catalyst for Formula 1’s burgeoning popularity in America. The influx of new fans, drawn in by the on-track drama and off-track intrigue depicted in ‘Drive to Survive,’ contributed to record-breaking attendances at the Austin Grand Prix, TV viewership increasing by 300,000 from the previous year and injected renewed enthusiasm into the sport. </p>
    <p class="mb-30"><b>Lack of Competitiveness</b></p>
    <div class="details-img">
    <img class="img-fluid mb-15" src="assets/img/winter-2024/articles/budget-airlines/ba-3.svg" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;margin:10px 0px; max-height: 500px">
    </div>
    <p> In recent years Formula 1 has attempted to make changes to its rulebook to try and cultivate competition, this includes introducing a $145 million cost cap back in 2021 and car design changes in 2022. While there was intense competition throughout the rest of the grid, as 6 teams finished in the top 3, and the Mercedes vs Ferrari battle for second place went down to the last race - Verstappen and Red Bull won all but one race. Totto Wolff the team principal for Mercedes said, “If the spectacle is not good, our fans are going to follow us less, of course, there is the risk that people are going to say, ‘Well, I know the result anyway,’ like it happened to us with Lewis. We’ve just got to do a better job.” Toto was right and the harmfulness of this is being seen now as TV viewership dropped in 2023, which can be attested to the lack of competition at the front of the grid. </p>
    <p> Previously, the TV viewership for the sport has risen and then faced a dip like what has happened in 2023, but what is unique about F1’s current predicament is the people who have stopped watching F1. Analyzing responses in surveys from many younger American fans of F1 who were introduced to the sport in 2021, the majority of survey respondents communicated that they stopped watching the sport in 2023 because of the lack of competition at the front of the grid. Many said that since they were introduced in the 2021 season when F1 was at its most competitive and interesting, subsequent seasons haven’t been competitive enough to retain their interest in watching Formula 1. In comparison, many younger fans from Europe communicated the fact that they feel as though Formula 1 is a way of life and it holds strong cultural significance, so despite the lack of competition they would continue to watch grand prixes. Many of the older fans of the sports are accustomed to seeing teams dominate for stretches of time, whereas the younger, newer American fans aren’t used to that and this lack of competition is driving them away from the sport. This is quite troubling for Liberty Media, as their chief initiative was to increase engagement with these younger American fans, but it seems they are now losing them just as quickly as they gained them. This ultimate lack in competition has led to a decline in TV viewership for the sport. TV ratings for the U.S. Grand Prix dropped for the third consecutive year in 2023, pulling a rating of just 0.47 and an average viewership of 882,000. In 2023, ABC saw a decline in viewership for the Miami Grand Prix drop by 26%, and social impressions from 2022 to 2023 declined by 279%. Not just that but, the average viewers per grand prix has decreased by 110,000 from 2022. This decline in viewership is indicative of the challenges facing F1 in retaining the interest of American audiences, especially those who were introduced to the sport during the electrifying 2021 season.  </p>
    <p class="mb-30"><b>Failed Economic Model</b></p>

    <p> Besides just missing the mark with their target crowd, Formula 1's actions have left a sour taste, painting a picture of prioritizing money over fan enjoyment. Take the Las Vegas Grand Prix, for instance. The first practice session, which set fans back around $1000 a ticket, got canceled after a measly eight minutes thanks to a dodgy manhole cover. Fans who'd been camping out for hours got the boot at 1:30 in the morning, and to add insult to injury, the compensation from F1 was nowhere near the price paid for tickets. On top of that, F1 management decided to clamp down on non-paying fans, going as far as obstructing views from bridges and buildings, chopping down trees near the Bellagio, and causing chaos on public transport during stand construction. These moves not only angered Las Vegas locals but also painted F1 as cash-hungry and more interested in lining their pockets than giving fans a good time, especially in the eyes of American audiences. It's incidents like these that chip away at the sport's reputation and drive a wedge between fans, making it harder for Formula 1 to win back trust and loyalty in the US. </p>
    <p> Moreover, Formula 1 appears to have miscalculated the potential live audience stemming from its Netflix viewership. While someone willing to invest in a $15 Netflix subscription may not balk at the cost, shelling out $1500 for a ticket is an entirely different proposition. Compounded by the reality that the actual live experience may not match the heightened excitement portrayed in the show, it's understandable why new enthusiasts might hesitate. For middle-income fans, the financial leap to attend live races is often overwhelming. Formula 1 must acknowledge that pricing races too steeply risks alienating its genuine American fan base. Surveys among middle-income Formula 1 enthusiasts in the US consistently reveal cost as the primary barrier to attending races. Moreover, there's a pervasive sentiment that Formula 1 neglects affordability concerns, leaving many feeling marginalized by the sport. This underscores Formula 1's flawed economic strategy, which prioritizes catering to the wealthy elite over cultivating a sustainable fan base among loyal supporters from diverse financial backgrounds. </p>
    <p class="mb-30"><b>No True American Team</b></p>
    <div class="details-img">
    <img class="img-fluid mb-15" src="assets/img/winter-2024/articles/budget-airlines/ba-6.svg" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;margin:10px 0px; max-height: 500px">
    </div>
    <p> The explanations offered by Formula 1 failed to appease the racing community, prompting questions into the rejection of Andretti Autosport and casting doubt on Formula 1's genuine commitment to involving America in the sport. Andretti Autosport, renowned for its extensive years in racing and the loyalty of its fanbase, held the potential to attract a substantial following of American enthusiasts, which could have enriched the sport's fan base. Rejecting Andretti Autosport's bid to join the sport represents a missed opportunity to cultivate a genuine American presence and tap into the rich heritage of American motorsport. This exclusionary approach only serves to alienate fans and reinforces the perception that F1 prioritizes profit over inclusivity. These actions give the appearance that F1 is interested in the money and facilities America provides, but have no interest  in letting America be a part of the sport.  </p>
    <p class="mb-30"><b>Navigating the Gridlock</b></p>
    <p> Formula 1's struggles to expand its presence in America underscore the importance of understanding local markets and catering to the preferences of diverse fan bases. While the allure of high-profile events and glamorous locations may yield short-term gains, the long-term sustainability of Formula 1's presence in America hinges on fostering competitiveness, affordability, and inclusivity. By addressing these key challenges and prioritizing fan engagement over financial gain, Formula 1 can unlock the full potential of the American market and secure its position as a leading force in global motorsport. As the sport continues to evolve, it is imperative that Formula 1 remains attuned to the needs and desires of its American fan base, cultivating a lasting legacy that transcends borders and celebrates the rich tapestry of motorsport culture. </p>
