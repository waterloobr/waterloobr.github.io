                            <p class="mb-30">
                                In 1959, around 1700 billion cubic meters of natural gas were found in Holland’s
                                Groningen region. At the time, gas prices were near their all time high and the Dutch
                                had a relatively strong ability to harvest oil through the Nederlandse Aardolie
                                Maatschappij (NAM), which was jointly owned by Esso and Shell. The discovery of natural
                                gas was believed to enable the Dutch economy to grow and prosper, which it appeared to
                                do so through the 70s: the Dutch Guilder appreciated by 16.4% between 1971 and 1977,
                                social security benefits made up over 23% of national income versus 16.5% in 1970, and
                                regulations were put in place establishing minimum wages, employment standards and
                                environmental standards. The discovery of natural gas seemed to pave a road to long-term
                                prosperity for the region.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                By 1977, 80% of government revenue came from the natural gas. Despite the positive
                                outlook at the time, the country began to crumble from the inside out. Industrial
                                production had not increased during the 70s and employment in the manufacturing
                                industry, which was once Holland’s strongest industry, declined by 16%. Corporate
                                investment fell nearly 15%, and the proportion of people that qualified for their
                                long-term benefits program increased from 20% in 1965 to more than 60% in 1977. Their
                                overreliance on natural gas exports led to a dollar so strong that Holland could not
                                sell any other goods for a reasonable price. This interior collapse of a nation, despite
                                a positive economic image, was coined as the term “Dutch Disease”.

                                At the time, Dutch Disease was believed to be caused by an overreliance on one export.
                                However, in the time since, it appears as though many nations have found success by
                                relying on a single export, while others have been destroyed by it. Though previously
                                unavoidable and misunderstood, Dutch Disease plagues nations that rely solely on one
                                export but is entirely avoidable through strong fiscal policy.

                            <p class="mb-30"><b>Modern Single-Export Nations</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Dutch disease introduced the concept that relying on a singular export has harmful
                                repercussions. However, when we look at today’s economy, we see many successful and
                                unsuccessful nations that were born out of single export reliance, with common trends
                                arising from both sides. Oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE come
                                to mind as nations that have been able to utilize the export they rely upon to prosper.
                                Though diversification might be the obvious answer to their success, entering new
                                industries is extremely challenging when a nation does not have strong leadership or
                                direction. The leaders of these oil rich nations have chosen to do 3 main things: invest
                                in a sovereign wealth fund, invest in strategic industries, and control their oil
                                companies.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment vehicles that are often funded by natural
                                resources and are used by a nation to diversify their interests into different
                                industries. Based on size, the UAE’s SWF is the 3rd largest, Saudi Arabia’s is the 6th
                                largest and Qatar’s is the 9th largest globally. These SWFs invest into industries that
                                the host country had not found success in, such as Qatar’s SWFs investments into sports
                                and tech, or the UAE’s investments into technology and travel. This presents a unique
                                way to avoid Dutch disease, as a nation's rising dollar affects their exports but not
                                investments.

                                The industries that these nations appear to invest most in are the tourism and business.
                                It appears as though their main goal is to bring foreigners in and keep them there for
                                various reasons. For wealthy businesspeople, this means giving large tax incentives to
                                encourage the growth of tech and finance in the country. For poor migrant workers, this
                                means cheap labor and infrastructure development. It's a way for these oil-rich
                                countries to increase their economic complexity while not actually relying on exports,
                                but rather being attractive destinations to visit or live in, and using their high
                                dollar to earn greater revenue from these newcomers.

                                The final piece of this puzzle is overall government control. If the government can
                                control the oil companies and those who operate it, they can avoid issues from Dutch
                                Disease that were akin to the nations overreliance on their oil workers. Currently,
                                roughly half of the world's oil production comes from state-owned companies such as
                                Sinopec, QatarEnergy, Emirates National Oil, Aramco and Kuwait Oil Company, which are
                                all from Asia and the Middle East. This number is expected to grow over the next decade
                                as they are entirely self-sustaining and can collaborate through OPEC: an organization
                                made up of oil nations like Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others around the
                                Middle East. Having a central power in charge of a country’s main oil company ensures
                                decisive action and a greater ability to secure a strong workforce, while ensuring that
                                oil profits suit the nations need. After all, the rulers get rich as the nation gets
                                rich, so it is in their best interest for oil production to continue.

                                The question then arises of how any nation can be unsuccessful with one export when
                                there are clear examples of those that have grown tremendously from their oil. Surely
                                there is a set of examples they can follow in order to prosper from their main export?
                                Countries today still have deteriorating economies similar to Dutch Disease due to
                                various factors that prevent them from capitalizing on their greatest export.

                                Single export nations that are unsuccessful appear almost “forced” to be reliant on one
                                export, not by circumstance but by outside forces. Banana republics are the perfect
                                example of this. 
                            </p>

                                Banana Republics are South American nations that are reliant entirely on bananas for
                                their economic expansion and became this way through foreign intervention. The rise of
                                Banana Republics was mainly due to the United Fruit Company, who’s first operation in
                                1871 started by building a railroad through Guatemala and Honduras. After realizing that
                                the project was not profitable and having been granted over 800,000 acres of land along
                                the railroad, they decided to expand into banana production. With control of over 13% of
                                the surrounding nations land mass and over 4000 workers by the 1930s, the United Fruit
                                Company had a heavy influence over the government purely because of the profit they
                                brought the nation. The ultimatum was simple: if the government does not comply with the
                                United Fruit Company, they could leave the nation and deprive them of their most
                                successful export. The most extreme case of government control came in December 1928,
                                when the famous “Banana Massacre'' left an estimated 2000 workers dead after they were
                                protesting their abhorrent living conditions while working in banana farms. The massacre
                                was led out by the Columbian military who were pressured by the United Fruit Company to
                                bring their labor back into work. The United Fruit Company had enough control of the
                                country that they could coerce Colombian leadership to lead out a massacre on their own
                                people, who were protesting the conditions that they were subjected to by a foreign
                                company, just for the country to get a meager share of the profits.

                                This presents the main differentiating factor in successful and unsuccessful
                                single-export nations: whoever controls the companies controls the profits. Successful
                                nations own their companies, such as Saudi-owned Aramco and Qatar-controlled
                                QatarEnergy. When profits are funneled out of a poor nation by a foreign power, the
                                living conditions in that nation do not improve and thus it is more challenging to
                                diversify. When large companies are state-owned, investment can be made to better the
                                nation and prosper.

                                A common argument is that the type of export is the main factor which decides if a
                                nation will be successful or not successful. After all, while oil-rich countries such as
                                the UAE and Qatar have thrived, banana-rich countries have suffered. Though one might
                                argue that Banana Republics are unsuccessful because their export is less desirable in
                                today’s economy, Nigeria has suffered in similar ways despite their main export also
                                being oil.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                95% of Nigeria’s exports are oil exports, which make up 40% of their total economy. The
                                vast majority of their oil wells are owned by Shell, who “purchased” oil fields from the
                                economy through shady-looking purchases that involved bribed government officials. Most
                                notably, the $1.3B purchase of OPL 245 led to $466M in the pockets of government
                                officials. Today, the country is so reliant on the oil giant that 65% of their
                                government revenue comes from oil. Though the relationship was initially symbiotic with
                                Shell gaining new oil fields and Nigeria getting new infrastructure, foreign investment,
                                labor opportunities and profits, Shell’s immense power was abused through massive oil
                                spills (they admitted to around 250 oil spills per year from 1997-2006) and power
                                consolidation. One of the most noteworthy acts is their devastation of Ogoniland, a
                                1000km add delta that was poisoned with oil spills, which Shell paid $83M to fix despite
                                the UNEP estimating that a $1B fund is needed to correct the environmental damage.

                                In 1994, Shell was also accused of complicity when 9 Ogoni men were protesting alongside
                                the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and got arrested and executed.
                                only $15.5M was paid to their families as settlement. These countries were taken over by
                                companies that demanded more power and destroyed their nations by making them reliant on
                                the exports that earned them the most profit. Dutch Disease is strong in nations that
                                have higher dollars and labor forces that are empowered by their reliance on one export,
                                but it is also strong in nations where their other exports are destroyed by
                                monopolization and their labor forces are suppressed by their own governments that act
                                as puppets to foreign conglomerates.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                In the times of Dutch Disease, it was believed that being reliant on one export caused
                                nations to fail. The same was seen in the 1970s when Great Britain found oil off the
                                coast of Scotland and they fell in a recession despite oil prices quadrupling. However,
                                we’ve seen nations such as the UAE and Qatar become net oil exporters while successful,
                                and net exporters such as Nigeria and Banana Republics be unsuccessful. So what causes
                                this difference?
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                We’ve already established that the type of export has little influence on the country's
                                success, with some oil nations finding success and some not. The UAE and Qatar were once
                                poor countries with exports such as fishing and farming, but were able to transform into
                                global superpowers. Nigeria is in a similar situation to pre-oil middle eastern
                                countries, but are still finding it difficult to progress. The main success factors lie
                                beyond the type of export.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                The other main idea is the possibility of collaboration. The largest oil exporters are
                                members of OPEC, which allows these countries to control global trade of oil by setting
                                volume mandates. If a country like Nigeria could join OPEC, it could perhaps find more
                                success by being able to collaborate with some of the other exporters. Banana Republics
                                could form their own type of OPEC and control global banana exports, asserting how much
                                volume can be distributed and controlling prices as a result. However, there is one
                                large factor that prevents this from being possible that defines the main factor which
                                separates successful and unsuccessful single export nations.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-30">
                                The success of single export nations is solely dependent on their foreign policy and
                                level of government control. When a nation is able to learn from the lessons of Dutch
                                Disease and quickly expand into new industries through an investment vehicle or
                                government spending, they are able to benefit from their profits from any export that
                                they might rely on. This is only possible with strong foreign policy, where spending is
                                constantly monitored and trends are understood.

                                We spoke with an individual from the IMF who has studied the effects of foreign policy
                                on the success of a nation. Through in-depth discussion and ideation, we learned that
                                nations suffer when their economies are informal and their labor costs are too high,
                                which pose as barriers to growth as the nation might try to create an entity to generate
                                profit through successful exports. The defining factor between success and failure in
                                the eyes of this individual was a country's economic framework. Countries need to
                                control their exports, but their success is defined by much more than that: they also
                                need to look at their education levels, their labor laws and their investments. The way
                                forward for suffering nations is unclear, said this individual, but they must start by
                                taking control of their resources and using their profits to encourage long term
                                prosperity.

                            <p class="mb-30">
                                It appears as though the goal of every single export nation is to diversify away from
                                that export. This is seen globally through the Middle East's growth in tourism, Norway’s
                                sovereign wealth fund and even Canada’s own pension plans that were developed from their
                                oil sands. Dutch Disease is a condition gained from being reliant on an export for too
                                long, and these countries are trying their best to diversify as quickly as possible in
                                order to avoid the condition. This is simply not possible when foreign companies obtain
                                too much share of a nation's profits and prohibits them from expanding into new
                                industries and rather forces them to stay entirely focused on the one export that brings
                                them the most success for their bottom line. The solution is clear: control the profits
                                and invest them in a way where the country can avoid over reliance.
