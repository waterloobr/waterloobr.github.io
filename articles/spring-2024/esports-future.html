                                <p> When an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic struck the world in 2020, the global
                                    financial system faced a severe strain on resources. Industries like sports and
                                    entertainment in particular were met with difficult economic downturns due to
                                    operational challenges, and health and safety concerns. However, despite the severe
                                    struggle, there was one industry that performed beyond expectations: esports.
                                    Electronic Sports, better known as esports, is a broad term for competitive video
                                    games, where tournaments are played between professional teams in organized leagues.
                                </p>
                                <p> As people were forced to turn away from traditional sports and entertainment during
                                    the pandemic, the relatively new industry of esports continued to grow. In an
                                    international survey conducted by the Center for Esports Medicine, over 75% of
                                    self-identified gamers reported spending more time gaming during the pandemic, with
                                    a particular increased interest in esports tournaments. Esports match viewership
                                    grew by more than 38 million throughout 2020, driven by the industry’s global
                                    audience, an active and passionate community, and generous sponsorships and
                                    investors. </p>
                                <div class="details-img">
                                    <img class="img-fluid mb-15"

                                <p> Despite this, the post-pandemic world reveals a different story regarding the future
                                    of esports. Although viewership continues to grow, organizations are not generating
                                    the same profits as they once did, and funds from sponsorships and investors are
                                    drying up. The aspects that initially allowed esports’ business model to succeed -
                                    such as the restriction of in-person events, which led to increased streaming
                                    revenue and the number of non-traditional sponsors capitalizing on the marketing
                                    opportunity - have now become the hurdles that the industry must overcome for its
                                    long-term success. This article will examine the necessary changes in the esports
                                    industry’s unsustainable business model, focusing on leveraging international
                                    funding and integrating with sports betting platforms as potential avenues to secure
                                    a sustainable revenue stream in an evolving market. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>An Overvaluation of the Industry</b></p>
                                <p> Driven by grand expectations and rapid market growth of the gaming industry during
                                    the pandemic, the esports industry mainly attracted investment from venture capital
                                    firms. The industry generated approximately $1.1 billion in revenue in 2021 from
                                    sources such as advertising, merchandising, franchise fees, ticket sales and media
                                    rights. Additionally, deal activity and funding for the esports industry peaked in
                                    2021, with 823 deals made in the year. However, the recent economically-contracting
                                    environment forced a harsh reevaluation of the industry’s growth prospects. While
                                    deal activity has continued into 2024, total fund levels have fallen to pre-pandemic
                                    levels, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. </p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid mb-15"
                                        src="assets/img/spring-2024/articles/esports-future/ef-2.svg" alt=""

                                </div>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> Another investor with growing interest in the industry is the Saudi Arabian Public
                                    Investment Fund (PIF). This interest mainly stems from wanting to improve the
                                    country’s image, and aid Saudi Arabia's broader Vision 2030 initiative, which seeks
                                    to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil revenues and cultivate a more diverse and
                                    dynamic economy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has actively invested in traditional
                                    sports like Formula 1, Golf, and Soccer. These sports tend to have many longtime
                                    sponsors and never have a shortage of funding, therefore it’s difficult for Saudi
                                    Arabia to exercise significant control of these sports with their investments.
                                    However, looking at esports, the country is focused on becoming a dominant force in
                                    the field, with the PIF investing $1 billion in 2020 to own 2% of Reliance
                                    Industries, a company that owns one of India’s largest esports organizations,
                                    Reliance Games. Moreover in 2022, the PIF created the Savvy Gaming Group (SGG) to
                                    invest 1.5 billion into owning various gaming platforms (ESL, FaceIt) and invest in
                                    gaming </p>

                                <p> While venture capital funding surged, with record highs in deals and funds raised,
                                    the industry struggled to convert this investment into consistent and reliable
                                    revenue streams, exposing financial issues. This is characterized by unreliable
                                    sponsorship deals, the average viewer’s limited spending power, and unsustainable
                                    spending on player salaries and tournament costs. Over the years there have been
                                    creative methods to source new streams of revenue, however, it’s clear that none
                                    have proven successful in the long term. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Embracing Saudi Arabian Funding</b></p>
                                <p> Embracing funding from Saudi Arabia represents a pivotal opportunity for the esports
                                    industry amidst its current economic challenges and need for stability. The Esports
                                    World Cup (EWC), backed by substantial Saudi investment, exemplifies this potential
                                    with its record-breaking prize pool exceeding $60 million and global participation
                                    from top esports organizations. While concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights
                                    record and motives for investing in esports persist, the financial infusion from
                                    entities like the Public Investment Fund could significantly bolster the industry's
                                    resilience and expansion. By forging partnerships and hosting large-scale events
                                    like the EWC, Saudi Arabia aims to position itself as a leading hub for esports,
                                    attracting international attention and fostering economic diversification. While
                                    ethical considerations are paramount and require careful navigation, the strategic
                                    benefits of embracing Saudi Arabian funding include enhanced global exposure,
                                    increased participation from top-tier teams, and the establishment of sustainable
                                    revenue streams necessary for the industry's long-term viability and growth. </p>

                                    Betting, with a market volume of US$2.5bn in 2024. Full integration of sports
                                    betting into esports represents a strategic move to diversify revenue streams and
                                    capitalize on the growing popularity of competitive gaming. </p>
                                <p> Riot Games, for example, has shown interest in potentially allowing betting brands
                                    to partner with teams within its Valorant esports ecosystem, despite current
                                    restrictions outlined in its competitive rulebook. </p>

                                <p> Esports Technologies, an online gambling platform, wants to bring esports gambling
                                    to a wider audience. The company filed a comprehensive patent provision on June 23,
                                    2021, that will allow betting on gaming competitions and live-streaming sports
                                    entertainment events. </p>
                                <p> This shift could unlock significant financial opportunities for esports teams, who
                                    are facing financial pressures from a tightening venture capital market and
                                    profitability challenges. Sports betting platforms offer a new avenue for fans to
                                    engage with esports beyond traditional viewership, fostering deeper connections and
                                    increasing viewership through heightened interest in match outcomes. By embracing
                                    responsible and regulated betting practices, esports can not only enhance fan
                                    engagement but also bolster financial stability, mirroring the successful
                                    integration of sports betting in traditional sports, which has driven substantial
                                    increases in viewership and revenue. As esports continues to evolve, leveraging
                                    sports betting could prove pivotal in sustaining growth and expanding its global
                                    footprint. </p>
                                <p class="mb-30"><b>Ethical Considerations </b></p>
                                <p> In looking at these two business strategies, ethical concerns will inevitably arise.
                                    Firstly, in leveraging international funding from Saudi Arabia, and relying on their
                                    funding for the industry's growth, there is an unavoidable issue of sportswashing,
                                    where investments in sports are used to divert attention from controversial actions
                                    or policies. Many fans of the industry argue that by associating events with the
                                    country, Saudi Arabia may be seeking to wash its image internationally while
                                    deflecting scrutiny. On the other hand, it is difficult to stop a country from doing
                                    this, as well as stop organizations that are in dire need of funding from partnering
                                    with the country. However, giving these ethical conundrums considerable thought is
                                    necessary. For sectors that require funding, financial collaborations with these
                                    kinds of organizations might seem inevitable, but it's crucial to be vigilant and
                                    respect moral principles. Industries can reduce the possibility of unintentionally
                                    supporting actions that go against their beliefs or the interests of their
                                    stakeholders by withholding full transparency about these partnerships. This
                                    proactive strategy not only protects against unethical behaviour but also encourages
                                    integrity and accountability. </p>

                                <p> Secondly, rules and regulations will need to be put in place for betting sites. With
                                    the majority of viewership coming from the youth, there is a heightened
                                    responsibility to ensure that betting practices are conducted ethically and
                                    responsibly. These regulations should encompass age restrictions, strict monitoring
                                    of gambling advertisements during esports broadcasts, and transparency in odds and
                                    payouts. </p>

                                    essential for its sustainable growth. By navigating issues of overvaluation,

                                    as a leading force in the global sports and entertainment landscape. </p>
