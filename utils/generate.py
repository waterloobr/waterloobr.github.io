        ("s", "Introduction"),
        ("p", "Today, our smartphones know more about us than many of our closest friends and family. The digital revolution has opened the floodgates for technology capable of digitizing every aspect of our lives. The ascendance of household devices, such as smart speakers, smart appliances and our beloved smartphones has shown us that technology can affect nearly every part of our lives. Additionally, the emergence of more nascent technologies in the fields of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI), such as the Meta Quest (Oculus) Headset, Apple’s recently released Vision Pro and ChatGPT, have shown us that technology may soon take a front seat in our lives. With the ubiquity of technology, we are invariably sharing more information through our devices than we may be comfortable sharing with most of the people we know, begging the question: are any parts of our digitized lives truly private?"),
        ("p", "Most people are familiar with the concept of spying, a practice as old as time, where groups or individuals secretly collect information about their enemies and competitors. The earliest forms of spying, referenced in Sun Tzu’s 5th Century book Art of War, were conducted physically; later, more sophisticated cyber espionage was developed during the Cold War, a time that saw the founding of the CIA and KGB. However, there is one recent technology making all other spying methods look like child’s play: Pegasus, engineered by NSO Group Technologies, a multi-billion dollar Israeli spyware firm."),
        ("s", "What is Pegasus?"),
        ("p", "Founded in Israel in 2010, the NSO Group is a product of its environment, as Israel is a global technological center in the heart of a major conflict zone. "),
        ("p", "Though plagued by war for nearly the entirety of its independence, Israel is often referred to as the Startup Nation as the tech sector makes up 18% of Israel’s GDP, 50% of its exports, and 30% of its tax revenue. Despite having just 0.1% of the world’s population, Israeli companies account for 10.5% of the world’s AI startups, according to Statista. Additionally, there has been no shortage of global high-tech companies forged in the Middle Eastern techno-cauldron. From the satellite navigation app Waze to the autonomous driving-tech company Mobileye and the popular website builder Wix.com, Israel has a strong tech industry and success to show for it. "),
        ("p", "One of the more controversial digital flowers that bloomed in Israel is the NSO Group. Most recently valued at $2.3 billion, the NSO group is one of the most secretive companies in the world and a global leader in spyware technology. Their flagship product, Pegasus, named after the legendary winged horse from Greek mythology, was released in 2011 and is only licensed to governments and law enforcement for “the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime”, according to the company’s website. "),
        ("i", "p-1"),
        ("p", "Pegasus is a sophisticated spyware that is capable of installing itself onto a victim's device without leaving a trace. Once installed, Pegasus gains full remote access to the victim’s device. This means that Pegasus can see all of the device’s passwords, phone and message records and location, as well as be able to turn on the camera and microphone, send messages and make calls on the victim’s behalf."),
        ("s", "What is a Zero-Click Attack?"),
        ("p", "What makes Pegasus especially advanced and hard to stop is its use of zero-click attacks to install itself on a victim’s device. Compared to the majority of spyware attacks, which are spear phishing attacks—requiring a victim to click a malicious link—zero-click attacks install software on a victim’s device without the victim ever clicking anything. This means that even if someone is careful with who they interact with, what they interact with and where they interact on the internet, they are vulnerable to zero-click attacks."),
        ("p", "Zero-click attacks take advantage of a loophole in most devices’ systems that trust data coming from trusted apps. Most downloads on modern devices either come through an app store manned by teams of hundreds of app reviewers, or have warnings associated with their online download from untrusted sources. However, there are fewer restrictions on data and downloads onto a device via already-installed apps, such as messaging or social media apps that allow for sending data between strangers with relative ease. Recognizing this loophole, zero-click attackers target apps, sending malicious code to victims’ devices through apps like WhatsApp*, email and SMS messaging, that attempt to seep into the device itself. As soon as the device is compromised, the hacker effectively has access to all the functions in the victim’s phone, meaning the malicious message could be erased from the device, without the victim ever knowing, leaving virtually no trace that the attack ever happened."),
        ("s", "Why is This Important?"),
        ("p", "Pegasus remains prominently used around the world. Between August 2016 and August 2018, Pegasus spyware was found to have likely been used to spy on individuals in 45 countries. Even the FBI revealed that they purchased a Pegasus license in 2019."),
        ("p", "Governments around the world are using Pegasus to track terrorist movements, but also to undermine political campaigns, expel ideological dissidents and suppress free speech. However, you do not have to be a politician, activist or journalist to be targeted by a Pegasus attack. "),
        ("p", "In the connected world of digital media, people are linked to one another in more ways than ever. If someone interacted with a political party’s social media page, is seen in a photo with an activist or was on the mailing list of a controversial journalist, they could potentially be targets of a government that licenses Pegasus. Your digital presence is something that follows you for a lifetime, and Pegasus could be used to expose it."),
        ("i", "p-2"),
        ("p", "*Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, sued the NSO Group in 2019 for the targeted use of Pegasus to spy on 1,400 of its users. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the NSO Group’s claim for immunity in January 2023, which argued that the company was acting as an agent for foreign governments, the case remains ongoing in the U.S. District Court of Northern California."),
        ("p", "In response to the first revelations of Pegasus, Edward Snowden, the famous U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower said that, traditionally, for an agency to access a suspect’s phone, they would need to “break into somebody’s house” with a warrant. However, with Pegasus, “they can do the same thing from a distance, with little cost and no risk” and “do it all the time, against everyone who’s even marginally of interest”. "),
        ("p", "Snowden added that this is “an industry that shouldn’t exist”. Nonetheless, it does exist, and we are seeing the consequences regularly and all around the world."),
        ("s", "Uses of Pegasus Software"),
        ("p", "In 2011, the Mexican government became Pegasus’s first client. Since then, Mexico has been a case study for both the abundant potential for security as well as the oppression of individuals that Pegasus brings to a nation. "),
        ("p", "As a tool designed to thwart terrorism and crime, Pegasus has been used in many high-profile cases in Mexico for that exact purpose. Pegasus has been used by the Mexican government to fight crime and bring down child abuse rings. On Christmas Eve 2011, the President of Mexico called the NSO Group to say: “I couldn't have asked for a better Christmas present. With what you gave us, we can finally eradicate the cartels”. Sure enough, the NSO Group claimed that Pegasus was used to track, and eventually capture, the notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera in February 2014, after he escaped from a maximum security prison thirteen years earlier. "),
        ("p", "However, while the primary purpose of Pegasus is for governments to fight crime and terrorism, Pegasus’s real-world uses have extended far beyond that. "),
        ("p", "Jamal Khashoggi was a prominent Saudi journalist who covered major stories such as the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of al-Qaeda’s former leader Osama Bin Laden. Khashoggi served as an advisor to Saudi Arabia’s royal family before falling out of favour and going into self-imposed exile on two separate occasions: to London in 2003 and then to the U.S. in 2017. While writing for the Washington Post in the U.S., Khashoggi published a monthly column criticizing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler at the time. On September 28, 2018, Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. His body was never found and the UN issued a statement saying that Khashoggi’s death \“constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible\" and that there was \"credible evidence\" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed. Amnesty International’s Security Lab later uncovered that Pegasus was used to hack the devices of Khashoggi’s wife, new fiancee, as well as his associate Wadah Khanfar, who was an Al Jazeera journalist, within a period beginning six months before the murder. The NSO Group vehemently denies that Pegasus was used to monitor Khashoggi, his relatives or his associates, contradicting the report by Amnesty International’s Security Lab as well as Saudi Arabia’s known use of Pegasus and its tarnished human rights record. "),
        ("p", "In 2021, a list of 50,000 phone numbers was published with clues as to who may be the target of past, present and future Pegasus attacks. The list included two Turkish officials deeply involved in the Khashoggi homicide investigation. Although NSO Group called the list “exaggerated” and the origin of the list remains unknown, an investigation by The Washington Post and sixteen media partners concluded a “tight correlation” between “a [phone number] on the list and the initiation of surveillance”. Reporters identified more than 1,000 numbers on the list, including 65 executives, 85 activists, 189 journalists, and more than 600 politicians, which included French President Emmanuel Macron, Pakistan’s then-Prime Minister Imran Khan and Morocco’s King Mohammed VI. However, the greatest concentration of numbers was in Mexico, which made up over 30% of the list."),
        ("i", "p-3"),
        ("p", "In Mexico, Pegasus has been used in the suppression of journalists, democracy advocates and accusers of Mexican corruption. Javier Valdez was one of dozens of Pegasus’s victims in the country. Valdez was a Mexican journalist and founder of Río Doce, a newspaper in Sinaloa, the home of El Chapo’s Sinaloa cartel. Valdez investigated and reported on Mexican cartels, winning the International Press Freedom Award in 2011 for his courageous journalism. On May 15, 2017, Javier Valdez was shot 12 times in an assassination that was condemned by the U.S. embassy in Mexico, the EU, and the UN. It was later confirmed that Pegasus was used to infect the devices of Valdez’s wife, who was also a journalist, as well as two of Valdez’s colleagues at Río Doce."),
        ("p", "The NSO Group and many of their clients, including Mexico, are in a constant precarious dance of bilateral reliance. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who promised to ban the illegal spying of Mexico’s past was elected in 2018 and has, up until now, not lived up to that promise. On the other side, Israel’s Ministry of Defense (IMOD), which must approve all exports of Pegasus, said it would not approve sales of Pegasus to countries with a risk of human rights violations. However, IMOD continues to allow Pegasus to be used in Mexico, as well as countries including Kazakhstan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. "),
        ("p", "With Pegasus spyware, anyone can be spied on without them knowing, which could greatly impede their ability to do valuable work. We are nearing a reality where journalists can’t conduct interviews without endangering themselves and their sources, activists can’t hold meetings without risking government raids, and opposition politicians can’t plan campaigns without the party in power anticipating their every move. "),
        ("i", "p-4"),
        ("s", "What is Being Done"),
        ("p", "In recent years, human rights activists in the EU have been lobbying to ban Pegasus. In 2021, despite licensing Pegasus just two years earlier, the U.S. put NSO Group on the Entity List, heavily restricting its ability to conduct business in the U.S. This signalled a sharp revision of the U.S.’s stance on the technology: from embracing the innovative spyware to essentially banning it and citing the threat it poses to “the privacy and security of individuals and organizations”."),
        ("p", "Meanwhile, in the private sector, Apple and Google, which make up 99.3% of the mobile operating system market, have been taking action to protect their users’ digital privacy. "),
        ("p", "In July 2022, Apple launched “Lockdown Mode” on their devices, specifically designed to protect iPhone, iPad and Mac users from “highly sophisticated cyber attacks”, as detailed by the company’s website. The feature heavily restricts access to most apps, affecting both users and attackers, since apps are the most common attack points for zero-click attacks. The feature immediately paid dividends. It was reported that Apple’s “Lockdown Mode” successfully blocked one of “at least 3” instances of a Pegasus attack conducted by the Mexican Army in October of 2022 against two Mexican human rights defenders. The report was published in 2023 by the Citizen Lab, a human rights watchdog based out of the University of Toronto, whose researchers have been targeted by international undercover agents in the past."),
        ("p", "Meanwhile, Google has a Threat Analysis Group (TAG): a specialized team that “detects, analyzes, and disrupts serious and government-backed threats against Google and its users”. Additionally, Google is in the third year of a five-year pledge to invest $10 Billion into cybersecurity, which includes commitments to protect users from “nation-state actors” and other cybercriminals, according to Kent Walker, Google’s President of Global Affairs."),
        ("s", "How People Can Protect Themselves"),
        ("p", "It is so vital to stay connected in today’s digital society that even technology like Pegasus shouldn’t have anyone running for the hills and switching to pigeon post. Whether you are optimistic or pessimistic about the uses of spyware technologies such as Pegasus, it is inevitable that spyware will continue to be used by entities around the world, for good and for bad. "),
        ("p", "While it is nearly impossible to fully protect your device from a Pegasus attack—Edward Snowden compared it to protecting oneself from nuclear weapons—there are ways to better secure your device from those who may not have your best interests at heart. "),
        ("p", "Protecting yourself from spear-phishing attacks is straightforward: never click on suspicious links and always think twice before divulging personal information, especially to people you do not know. These precautions are especially important in a world where 1.2% of all emails are malicious and, each year, 88% of organizations face spear phishing attacks. "),
        ("p", "Moreover, aside from protecting your device from spear phishing attacks, there are precautions you can take against zero-click attacks. "),
        ("p", "Firstly, it is important to ensure that your device’s software is kept up to date. The companies behind the operating systems on most devices—including Apple iOS and Google Android—are constantly patching exploitable software and adding features to make their devices safer. By updating your device promptly, you are ensuring that any new security patches are installed on your device and attackers have a smaller window to take advantage of known vulnerabilities."),
        ("p", "Moreover, hackers rely on a large surface area to carry out their attacks, meaning the more points of entry on a device, the easier it will be for them to find weaknesses in one of them. To reduce your device’s attack surface, you should disable pop-ups and delete apps that you do not need. For essential apps, you should always download the official version from developers that you trust and make sure to keep them up-to-date."),
        ("s", "Future of Pegasus"),
        ("p", "Despite the dangers when misused, it is hard to deny that Pegasus truly has potential for good when in the right hands. We can only imagine how the world could be different if Pegasus was around, and used for prevention, during 9/11, the Madrid Train Bombings or other similar tragedies. The question is, who decides who the right hands are? "),
        ("p", "Companies, including the NSO group, often have profit goals and shareholder interests at heart.  Meanwhile, countries have internal, geopolitical, and economic interests that could influence their actions, including decisions about who to target or avoid targeting and which parties have access to powerful tools like Pegasus. Since 2019, Ukraine has been lobbying Israel to get access to Pegasus but has been refused, including at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine War, reportedly due to Israel’s fear of angering Russian officials by licensing Pegasus to a regional foe. Since Pegasus licensing currently requires the approval of Israel’s Ministry of Defense, Pegasus is frequently used as a bargaining chip supporting Israeli foreign policy."),
        ("p", "Maybe technologies like Pegasus should fall under the oversight of a supranational entity like the United Nations. The UN could be a calming force to provide oversight, establish ethical guidelines and ensure that all uses of Pegasus comply with international human rights laws. But the UN likely won’t be able to develop Pegasus in the way the NSO Group can. Additionally, what would be the incentive for the future development of bleeding-edge technologies that walk the line of good and evil in the name of technological development?"),
        ("i", "p-5"),
        ("p", "Either way, with each passing year, the world risks the emergence of more technologies that threaten our data, democracies, and lives. In a world where our online identities become increasingly prominent, we need to continue to advocate for companies and countries to prioritize people’s online safety. This needs to include implementing policies that make clear when individual data can be legally accessed; for example, in a criminal investigation or in cases, beyond reasonable doubt, of illegal activity. Moreover, as cyberweapons become more powerful, and cybercrime has become a common prelude for physical crime, it is crucial to punish cybercriminals and cybercrime enablers, in the second degree for any crimes that result in their actions and careless distribution of their technologies. Finally, the world, including both the public and private sectors, must continue investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and developing technologies that can protect their people and users from cyberattacks. We must continue developing vaccines for the digital viruses we know are coming."),

        ("s", "Introduction"),
        ("p", "For many Canadians, the COVID-19 pandemic represented a brutal start to the 2020s. Lives were forever altered, numerous companies collapsed, and the financial markets were in disarray. Remarkably, in this rather depressing economic state, Canada’s tech ecosystem reached its pinnacle. Dubbed the “Canadian Tech Boom”, 2021 was a record-breaking year in which venture capital investments were at an all-time high; tech giants, like Microsoft, expanded their Canadian presence, and new talent stayed local due to the restrictions limiting travel."),
        ("p", "However, as the pandemic subsided and restrictions were lifted, the tech heyday fizzled out. It became glaringly clear that the flaws impairing this country’s tech industry resurfaced. The U.S. alternative proving once again why it is the mecca for success and growth in technology, as Canada continues to struggle with the lure of Silicon Valley poaching its STEM graduates, local startups looking to investors down south, and innovation thriving in the U.S. tech industry as Canada’s lags behind in R&D investments."),
        ("p", "Nevertheless, this period of distinctive success proved that the country has the potential to be a dominant technology hub. Lamentably, the fact remains that in this post-COVID environment, Canada’s startup and technology ecosystem remains fractured and the country’s venture capital presence, founders, and new graduates are spilling through the cracks into the United States. If these realities are not sufficiently addressed, Canada risks losing a significant portion of its future position as a global leader in technology. "),
        ("p", "The article hopes to promote potential avenues in which the country can effectively grow its technology industry and address harmful insufficiencies in order to strengthen Canada’s position on the global stage while maintaining the characteristics that make the industry uniquely Canadian. These avenues include bolstering investment in R&D, collaborative action by Canadian universities and companies to invest in their talent and research, and addressing how local VC investors may play an active role in boosting the Canadian technology environment despite the risk aversion plaguing the asset class. "),
        ("s", "Bolstering investment in R&D"),
        ("p", "Research and development (R&D) is a critical driver of future economic prosperity as it stimulates growth through innovation, invention, and progress. Investment in R&D can result in breakthroughs that drive profits for companies and the well-being of consumers."),
        ("p", "A study released in June from Boston Consulting Group’s Centre for Canada’s Future found that Canada ranked second to last on total R&D spending per capita among its international peers. According to the data, Canadian R&D spending per capita averaged US$700, with 52% of spending coming from business activity, while the remainder came from government or higher education. In comparison, the United States hit US$2,000 in R&D investment per capita, with 75% of spending coming from business activity, while the minority came from public institutions."),
        ("i", "tg-1"),
        ("p", "This has proven to be a trend as in 2021, U.S. firms spent almost 103x more than Canadian firms on R&D, with a total of $529 billion compared to Canada’s $5.2 billion, despite U.S. GDP only being 11.7x greater than Canada’s. Unfortunately, Canada’s science and technology organizational structure is severely outdated as it operates nearly exactly as it has since the 1950s. Over several decades, Canada’s economic policy objectives have remained vague, focusing mainly on the politics of “job creation.” The country’s capacity to take on research at scale is insubstantial, still relying heavily upon incremental innovation and safe bets. Realistically, Canada surpasses the majority of international competition in terms of public institutions disbursing experimental ideas to the marketplace. Yet, this is inconsequential as low business investment in R&D has resulted in low business demand for these ideas. "),
        ("p", "In order to establish its presence as a dominant tech hub, Canada must work diligently to institutionalize technology transfers from public R&D to industry. The country should consider the United States and its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as a model for transformative technologies that could be applied to complement the Canadian landscape. DARPA’s extensive resume is undeniable, consisting of generational innovations such as the internet, RISC, global positioning satellites, drones, etc. The DARPA model does not simply focus on early-stage idea generation and activation. Rather, it breaks down its role as follows: (1) catalyzing breakthroughs and (2) assisting them through the innovation process. Similarly, in the Netherlands, TNO, the country’s national applied research organization, provides significant contributions to the Dutch growth strategy by developing and transferring technologies that help companies boost their productivity and retain their license to operate. "),
        ("p", "Overall, rational companies will turn away from investing in breakthrough technologies, despite the rewards, if it involves high levels of risk and uncertain R&D timeframes. In turn, this requires governments to take a more hands-on approach. As briefly touched upon above, the internet, GPS, and touch screen are the direct results of partnerships formed between the public and private sectors in other countries to solve a problem. Canada’s technology industry would benefit from implementing this similar model within future and current organizations (i.e., Canadian Innovation Corporation) that would focus largely upon “use-driven” research directed at resolving practical issues utilizing breakthrough technologies which, in turn, also solves the market failure and cracks in Canada’s innovation ecosystem."),
        ("s", "Universities need to incentivize companies to invest in their talent and research"),
        ("p", "The \"Cali or Bust\" mentality among Canadian STEM students, where many want to pursue opportunities in Silicon Valley as opposed to staying in Canada, is a concerning trend that reflects the challenges in Canada's science and tech ecosystem. According to Global Mail, Canada has been the worst-performing advanced economy in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development since 1976, with a significant brain drain of highly skilled tech workers heading to the U.S. annually, indicating a broken research and innovation ecosystem."),
        ("p", "Currently, Canada is experiencing a loss of two-thirds of recent software engineering graduates and a third of computer engineering and computer science graduates to the United States. To combat this trend, Canada can look to successful models, such as Samsung's collaboration with South Korean universities. Samsung's partnerships involve a comprehensive five-year program that integrates graduate and undergraduate students, providing them with industry-specific academic training and internship opportunities in the semiconductor space. This collaborative approach fosters a direct link between academia and industry, nurturing talent and preventing the brain drain that Canada is currently experiencing."),
        ("i", "tg-2"),
        ("p", "To counter this trend, universities must incentivize companies to invest in talent and research, by creating incentives such as increasing salaries, enhancing co-op placements with Canadian firms, and boosting government funding for research and development. By enhancing funding through programs like the federal government's Research Support Fund, universities can play a significant role in bridging the gap between research and industry, ultimately stabilizing Canada's position in the global technology landscape. This attracts Canadian students while making these institutions competitive on a global scale. When students have opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research projects, they are more likely to stay local to be part of these initiatives."),
        ("p", "Without urgent measures to stabilize the technological skilled-labor market, Canada risks losing its technological future to global competitors. "),

        ("p", "Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):"),
        ("p", "Governments can encourage collaboration between public institutions, such as universities, and private companies through PPPs. These partnerships can involve joint funding for research projects, shared resources, and a commitment to leverage outcomes for mutual benefit. This allows students to engage in collaborative industry-related projects with companies locally rather than seeking these opportunities abroad. "),
        ("p", "Skills Development and Talent Retention:"),
        ("p", "By investing in educational programs that align with industry needs, universities can contribute to the development of a skilled workforce. This not only addresses the talent drain issue but also ensures that graduates are well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to the workforce, making them attractive to Canadian companies. A skilled workforce attracts businesses, leading to economic growth, increased tax revenue, and reduced unemployment, resulting in a positive economic impact for the Canadian government."),
        ("p", "Global Competitiveness: "),
        ("p", "Governments can position their investments as strategies to enhance the country's global competitiveness. If governments invest in new Canadian graduates, it would contribute to the country's reputation as a problem solver, attracting partnerships, and opening opportunities for economic growth. A thriving research and innovation ecosystem can lead to the development of cutting-edge technologies and solutions to future problems. "),
        ("s", "The role Canadian VCs need to undertake"),
        ("p", "Gone are the days of the investor “FOMO” that ran rampant when VC funding hit its peak in 2021; venture capitalists are now far more comfortable sitting on the sidelines. This strong inclination towards risk aversion is the result of multiple factors, such as rising interest rates, public market valuations restricting VC-backed exits through IPOs, and more. This has contributed to venture being the sole private investment strategy that produced a negative one-year return on a global scale. The distinctiveness of this outcome is substantiated by venture having topped the global charts within private investment strategies for three and five-year returns, and ranked second behind only private equity for ten-year returns. From a positive angle, this establishes that VC has a storied history of behaving as a pivotal driver of economic growth and progress in countries across the world, Canada undeniably included."),
        ("p", "Nonetheless, the recent international trends plaguing the industry have been blatantly apparent within the country. This is clearly depicted in the first half of 2023, in which VC disbursements to Canadian companies amounted to ~$3 billion, representing a roughly 60% decrease from that same period in 2022. Yet, while the lack of funding is unquestionably concerning, this is plausibly not a pressing long-term issue. In fact, an argument can easily be made that the following current market conditions make a rather convincing argument for continuing to invest in Canadian technology startups:"),
        ("p", "1. Valuation multiples have considerably decreased, causing entry multiples to decrease.  This regression helps investors enhance confidence regarding a company’s ability to exit at similar valuation levels, thus setting less risk upon the exit-multiple."),
        ("i", "tg-3"),
        ("p", "2. Pursuing profitability has become the main priority for tech companies, as the lack of funding discourages them from operating in “cash burn mode”. Ultimately, producing fundamentally sustainable and reliable businesses for investors to diligence."),
        ("p", "Regardless, it appears that international investors are far more intrigued by these investing conditions than their Canadian counterparts. In H1 2023, U.S. VC firms provided the majority of the ~$3 billion in funding, accounting for 44% ($1.43 billion) of total VC investments. International investors, outside of North America, totaled 16% of investments and the remaining 40% was provided by Canadian investors. These results have extended from 2021 in which 72% of investments in Canadian firms were made by foreign investors, with 56% coming from the U.S. alone. To the country’s benefit, the diversification in the regional source of capital in Canada shows increasing international recognition of the competitiveness of Canadian startups and the attractiveness of the local venture capital asset class. "),
        ("i", "tg-4"),
        ("p", "However, these statistics also raise valid concerns regarding the probability of keeping Canadian startups local in order to continue reaping the economic benefits that come with their exits and continued success. When analyzing Canada’s tech heyday, of approximately 400 VC-backed companies involved in M&A between January 2019 and February 2021, over half were acquired by foreign investors. Of those that stayed local after being taken over, 71% had a majority of original Canadian investors, suggesting that a greater share of domestic owners is a decent predictor that a company’s post-takeover owners will also be Canadian. Overall, this illustrates the need for Canadian investors to be active and majority investors in our local startups, as their participation bolsters economic progress and the tech landscape from the early-stage startup to exit."),
        ("s", "Conclusion"),
        ("p", "Canada’s technology ecosystem suffers from a number of critical flaws that are creating opportunities for international competitors to swoop in and extract startups, emerging talent, and the significance of local venture capital investors. Paired alongside a dreary macroeconomic environment that overshadows the country’s strengths, the days of the “Canadian Tech Boom” could not seem further away. However, this sentiment does not negate from the fact that the country’s technology industry is brimming with potential. From world-class universities to a storied history of successful local startups and technology investments, Canada has the ability to right the ship and cement itself as a top technology destination. The many statistics that afflict the prosperity of the country’s tech sector are clear and the individual industry and institutional roles that can be enacted have been outlined. The overarching theme is that these varying groups will not maximize innovation and success if they work in isolation.

This article contends that despite the ostensibly positive themes surrounding the rebuilding of economies through foreign investment for many underdeveloped countries, the net impact on the people in those economies is often negative as it results in debt-trap diplomacy, exploitative labor practices and cultural erosion. Through the lens of historical examples, this argument will explore impacts that shed light on the dark side of foreign investment."),

The Latin American Debt Crisis of the 1980s stands as a stark example of how foreign investment, while initially intended to spur economic development, resulted in a web of debt that ensnared the region for years to come. In the 1970s, many Latin American countries eagerly embraced foreign loans to finance ambitious development projects. These loans, primarily from international banks, were often used to modernize infrastructure, stimulate industrial growth, and address social issues."),
        ("p", "During this period, Mexico, under President José López Portillo, borrowed heavily to fund ambitious projects, including the state-run oil company Pemex. However, the global economic landscape shifted with the oil price shocks of the late 1970s. As oil prices skyrocketed, many Latin American countries, heavily dependent on oil exports, flourished momentarily, but the boom was short-lived. When oil prices plummeted in the early 1980s, countries like Mexico found themselves unable to service their burgeoning debts."),

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank stepped in with bailout packages, but these came with stringent conditions. The imposition of neoliberal economic policies, including austerity measures, privatization, and deregulation, exacerbated social inequalities and disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable segments of the population."),
        ("p", "In Brazil, for instance, the government, under pressure from creditors, implemented austerity measures that led to widespread unemployment, social unrest, and a decline in living standards.

The textile and garment industries became early beneficiaries of this influx of capital. However, the pursuit of low-cost production to remain competitive in the global market laid the groundwork for exploitative labor practices. Long working hours, low wages, and minimal job security characterized early sweatshops in these nations."),
        ("p", "As Japan and South Korea transitioned to higher-value industries, foreign investors shifted their gaze to Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The advent of globalization further fueled the demand for cheap labor, and multinational corporations sought to capitalize on the comparatively low production costs in these nations. The rise of the export-oriented industrialization model in the region brought about rapid economic growth but also entrenched the sweatshop culture."),
        ("p", "The 21st century witnessed the globalization of supply chains, with multinational corporations establishing a vast network of subcontractors across Asia. Countries such as China became epicenters of mass production, drawing millions of workers from rural areas to urban sweatshops. While economic growth surged, labor conditions deteriorated. Reports of child labor, unsafe working conditions, and egregious human rights violations became commonplace in the race to meet production quotas and maintain profit margins."),
        ("p", "Historically, Asian sweatshops have perpetuated a cycle of poverty rather than serving as vehicles for socio-economic upliftment. The promise of job creation and economic development has often come at the expense of the well-being of the labor force. The negative impact of foreign investment on the lives of workers, particularly in the garment and electronics industries, highlights the urgent need for ethical business practices, improved labor standards, and a more equitable distribution of the benefits of globalization.

Behind the clear progress made lies the reality of exploitation, debt entanglements, and shattered traditions. As explored in the article, despite the attractiveness of foreign investment as a catalyst for rebuilding distressed economies, these historical examples caution against blind optimism.

        ("p", "Japan was once the second largest economy in the world, with its economic presence so well established by the 1980s that some people anticipated it to become the next global economic powerhouse. However, Japanese society as a whole had several cultural and structural issues that were left unaddressed, which significantly impeded its ability to truly become the economic hegemon that they expected it to be. Now, coming into modern day, we examine how Japanese corporations have shaped the Japanese economy and how the country could propel itself back into an era of prosperity through its changing corporate landscape."),
        ("i", "j-1"),
        ("s", "History & Context"),
        ("p", "After the Second World War and before the advent of the Cold War, Japan saw tremendous economic growth, with its GDP rapidly increasing from $44.31B in 1960 to $3.13T in 1990. Dubbed the Japanese Economic Miracle, this period was brought about mainly due to technological changes and investment in various industries, along with economic reforms and heavy lending that led to the rapid industrialization of the Japanese economy. "),
        ("p", "Following this rapid growth, Japan faced a decade-long economic crisis, commonly known as “The Lost Decade”. This crisis originated due to excessive monetary easing that led to massive valuations in real estate and stocks, only for it to come crashing down in the early 1990s when the Bank of Japan tightened its monetary policy. "),
        ("p", "In the years after The Lost Decade, Japan’s economy remained stagnant. This was due to a multitude of external and underlying structural issues that impacted the country. Firstly, there was a rapidly aging population and decreasing birth rates. This meant that the proportion of people who were in the workforce and contributing to the economy was steadily being outnumbered by the retired population that needed to be provided for. Secondly, there were extremely high savings rates in the population and a declining trend in private investment. Finally, the corporate structure of Japan worked to culturally disincentivize foreign investment and the growth of shareholder profits. These structural issues, coupled with external shocks like the Tohoku disaster and The Great Recession, meant that the quantitative easing policies implemented in the 2000s forced the Japanese government to take on an incredible amount of debt. Consequently,  Japan held more public debt as a proportion of GDP than any other fully developed nation, further undermining their ability to become an economic powerhouse. "),
        ("i", "j-2"),
        ("s", "The Role of Corporations in the Japanese Economy"),
        ("p", "To explore how corporations play a role in the Japanese Economy and why it declined so heavily from the 1990s, we first need to understand their corporate structure."),
        ("p", "The Japanese corporate structure varies quite significantly from Western economies like the US. Firms in Japan tend to be more stakeholder-oriented than shareholder-oriented, and they are often interlinked with other firms in a system known as Keiretsu, which encourages partnership and cross-shareholding that limits the influence of external shareholders. In addition, they tend to have a board of directors dominated by insiders rather than the external BOD system that the US relies on to protect shareholder interests. Japanese employment culture further exemplifies firms’ stakeholder orientation. Firms encourage long-term employment through seniority-based pay instead of merit-based pay, and the average employee is fiercely loyal, with service firms existing for the sole purpose of quitting jobs on behalf of an individual.  These characteristics are fatal flaws as they mean that foreign investors, innovators and entrepreneurs have little incentive to invest in these corporations. In fact, despite it being the third-largest economy, Japan ranks low in all international reports on entrepreneurship. For example, in the 2023 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, Japan ranks 35th among 64 countries, well behind other developed economies such as the US, UK, Germany, and China, all found in the top 20."),
        ("p", "Over time, the Japanese government has made several reforms that aim to encourage a more shareholder-oriented focus in Japanese corporations. In 2014, stewardship codes were introduced to aid institutional investors in setting goals and disclosure for the firms that they invest in. Over 300 institutions in Japan participated in this disclosure as of 2023, driving profitability through active voting in the investee firms. "),
        ("p", "More recently, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has set certain policy goals surrounding wage growth in the country with an aim to encourage the growth of the economy. While these are just targets, it is important to consider that in a nation like Japan that is heavy on collectivist culture, merely setting these targets means that there will be a very active push from the government and corporations to meet these targets."),
        ("p", "The culture in Japan is very adequately summarized by the phrase, “The nail that sticks out is the one that is hammered down”. Japanese society has evolved in such a way that conformity and collectivism is expected and encouraged, which is precisely why in order for Japan to grow meaningfully, the government and institutions need to start incentivizing companies to bring about the changes they want to see. A recent example of this is the Japanese Exchange Group highlighting companies that succeed in improving shareholder value by bringing their price-to-book ratio above one. This added an underlying pressure to the 45% of companies that have not accomplished this task and would encourage them to prioritize value."),
        ("i", "j-3"),
        ("p", "These corporations that have long stood as bastions of stability and long-term employment in Japan are now increasingly recognized as vehicles for the country's economic growth. Firms are seeing more foreign investment, furthering their transition into a shareholder-oriented structure. In fact, a goal was set to double inward FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) by the Japanese government in 2013 and they achieved this by 2020, with inward FDI stock at about 8.4% of Japan’s GDP. Recognizing the importance of attracting FDI, the government announced in April 2023 that they plan to have their inward FDI stock reach 20% of their GDP by 2030."),
        ("p", "This cultural and structural transition is evident through cases like that of Sharp Corporation, a major player in Japan’s technology sector that was plagued by financial distress despite receiving two bank bailouts. Instead of turning to the banks again, Sharp Corporation ended up being acquired by the Taiwanese company Foxconn in 2016. The impact of this decision was evident in the market’s reaction to the news, fueling a 29% increase in the company’s share price over just two days. This decision essentially indicated to foreign investors that Japan was open to foreign involvement, with Sharp prioritizing market-driven decisions over state-backed alternatives. More recently, Warren Buffet himself has shown increased interest in the country by increasing Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in the top 5 trading companies in Japan to an average of more than 8.5%. This increased pressure from the government and increased attention to shareholders from corporations have resulted in the Nikkei 225, a major  Japanese stock exchange, reaching a 33-year high in 2023. The exchange index  appreciated nearly 30% over the year, indicating the positive outlook that global investors have for their economy."),
        ("s", "Conclusion"),
        ("p", "In researching this article, we had the opportunity to get in touch with the former president of the Japan Studies Association of Canada, Dr. Ken Coates, who provided incredible insight into how Japan tends to operate, with government and corporations working together for the sake of the country, rather than how it tends to work in the west where policies and reforms are imposed on the corporations and there isn’t a collectivist culture for the sake of the nation."),
        ("p", "This collectivist culture and cooperation between corporations and government will play a key role in the prosperity of the nation. Since Japan’s economic situation is challenging and multi-faceted, it will require several changes from the corporations, the people of the country and government action to bring about the changes required for their economy to truly prosper."),
        ("p", "From a societal point of view, there needs to be an active effort from the government, corporations and the people of Japan to encourage foreign investment and drive the growth of SMEs. Recent efforts like Beyond Japan, a program aimed at encouraging Japanese startup culture and wage hikes for SMEs at three-decade-long highs are steps in the right direction. It is easy to forget, but even massive corporations like Sony, Panasonic and Toyota who have contributed significantly to the Japanese economy were once startups."),
        ("p", "From a corporation's point of view, there needs to be a substantial shift from lifetime employment practices and seniority-based wage systems into a merit-based approach. These changes will encourage employee excellence and promote the growth of young entrepreneurs. There are already indications of a shift towards this mindset as evidenced by Toyota’s new CEO Koji Sato’s commentary that the firm will embrace a more flexible and merit-based approach to rewarding and promoting employees. As we see more companies adopting this approach, it slowly chips away at the residuals of a bygone era of stakeholder prioritization, leading to more growth for the Japanese Economy."),
        ("p", "Additionally, by further aligning themselves with the government’s targets for wage growth, putting more money in the hands of the Japanese population and spurring consumer spending, and overhauling outdated systems like seniority-based pay, the corporations of Japan have an incredible role to play in shaping the country’s economy for years to come."),
        ("p", "Japanese corporations, which are at a nexus of age-old practices and modern reforms, now have the opportunity to become a true catalyst for a new era of Japanese prosperity. This opportunity, when fueled by change, may finally put an end to the economic stagnation that has become synonymous with their economy."),

The transition towards a cashless society, beneath a facade of benefits, is marked by negative consequences, including disproportionate impacts on low-income individuals, financial illiteracy, and a heavy reliance on alternative payment methods such as credit. These consequences exacerbate economic disparities and accessibility for certain segments of the population."),

Credit and debit cards, on the contrary, are considered a safer medium compared to DeFi. They have played a central role in propelling society towards a cashless future, driven by the trifecta of convenience, speed, and security they offer.

With their tangible nature, cash transactions evoke unique psychological responses compared to cashless alternatives such as credit, cryptocurrency, and the recently popular Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) arrangements. A study by the National Library of Medicine found that non-cash payments not only reduce the “pain of paying”, but also evoke a “pleasure of paying”, potentially increasing the tendency to make impulsive purchases. Cash payments on the other hand trigger a heightened awareness of risk factors associated with purchase decisions, leading consumers to scrutinise product quality and evaluate health risks more attentively."),

The historical context, particularly when focusing on the Great Financial Crisis, reveals that banks have often taken advantage of the lack of financial literacy within the population. Predatory lending (defined as imposing unfair or abusive loan terms on a borrower) towards subprime borrowers was criticized for being one of the major factors that led to the 2008 financial crisis."),

Supply shortages are forecasted to last until March 2024, and diabetic patients who are in actual need of these treatments, are suffering with varying levels of blood sugar spikes. Without access to a steady supply of Ozempic, they are at high risk of experiencing heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. This, in turn, forces patients to search for the treatment at various pharmacies, with limited luck, or pay premium prices to compete with users seeking the treatment for weight loss. In the case of Wegovy, although Novo Nordisk is actively producing all doses of the treatment, demand is simply outpacing the supply.

This means that consumers without insurance would be paying $550/month and consumers with insurance could be paying as low as $25/month.

Furthermore, in trying to get FDA approval for Ozempic for children as young as 6, many concerns have been raised on potential gastrointestinal and muscle loss issues linked with the semaglutide treatments. Thus, many governments around the world have tightened regulations to prevent drugs like Novo Nordisk’s “Ozempic” from being prescribed as a weight loss treatment. The FDA has only approved “Ozempic” to be prescribed as a diabetes treatment and is actively trying to prevent it from being prescribed as a weight loss drug. In April of 2023, we saw exports of Ozempic from British Columbia to the USA drop 99%.

The BC government enacted regulations preventing this from happening and made sure that people with diabetes could get their dosage of Ozempic.

This would be a major blow to the Danish economy, as it contracted 0.1% when there was a 10.6% decline in the pharmaceutical industry’s output, so a decline in Novo Nordisk's revenue could lead to contraction in the Danish economy.

The rise of Nokia was primarily due to it being the first to mass-produce a mobile GSM phone (similar to Novo Nordisk being the first to mass-produce anti-obesity injections). Nokia maintained dominance over the mobile phone industry until an industry giant we are now familiar with called Apple came and took the world by storm with its iPhone. Nokia saw its dominance disappear and its exports fell by half causing the country to enter a deficit and a decade-plus of economic stagnation began. Many Finnish people saw themselves lose jobs and the per capita income in Finland decreased. "),

The success of the company draws many parallels to a traditional Dutch disease scenario, leading to growing concerns of Denmark’s over-dependence. It’s evident that, to avoid a situation akin to Finland and Nokia, collaborative efforts should be made between Danish policymakers, the government, and Novo Nordisk to focus on fostering sustainable growth, along with investing in Denmark’s lagging economic sectors."),

Each agency was fueled by establishing its political superiority as well as ensuring that it could not be threatened from the indefensible front of space through the Cold War. Space exploration has since been tied very closely to the governments of interested countries - even as the focus shifted from national defense to research and development, funding has consistently been sourced from ever-increasing budgets of 77 space agencies, led by NASA, the Russian Roscosmos, and the European Space Agency. "),
        ("p", "Since then, huge progress has been made in terms of research and establishing space programs and travel, but there exists huge potential still in applications that have not yet been achieved. Recently, with the rise of technology and the increase in private sponsors with huge amounts of funds, these expeditions have been slowly turned private, and have become out of the hands of government agencies and leaning into the aspirations of private citizens and their corporations. It is important to note that public and private companies have different agendas; public companies are held accountable for general well-being and welfare, whereas private companies focus on achieving profitability and maximizing shareholder value, often resulting in significant advancements in the development of technologies. Throughout history, the privatisation of industry has often led to greater efficiency and rapid advancement, but conflicting priorities lead to definite and distinct challenges. As these private space companies make further advances into practical exploration and industrialization, their priorities, in the long run, do not align with the good of the public or scientific ethos, which will lead to an overall decline in benefit and advancement."),
        ("s", "A Brief History of Privatization and Space"),
        ("p", "Privatization of an industry involves the transference for ownership from a public organization - like the government - to private parties. Historically, governments often chose to nationalize widespread activities, taking control of the governance and funding going toward public good services, primarily in areas of research, healthcare, transportation and education. The government's role, explicitly (with regards to privatization) was to create a foundation for emerging industries that the market would not be able to support on its own. Throughout the 1980s, issues were recognized in the management of widespread nationalist programs, specifically pertaining to the lack of efficiency created by a monopolist structure: when a stable budget is allocated and only one player is permitted to create goods and services, the incentive to make the structure of providing those services more efficient decreases. Hence, movement into the deregulation and liberalization of these industries become a popular method to reintroduce competition to stagnant markets."),
        ("p", "Space exploration developed as a nationalized program for two main reasons. Rapid development spurred by the race with the Soviet Union, in the interest of national security and pride. Throughout the Cold War, the American government poured immense amounts of funding into keeping up with the Soviets: the annual federal spending on space expenditures increased by six billion dollars between 1957 and 1964, much of this being attributed to defense funding research and development. As a result, NASA prevailed in 1969, sending Neil Armstrong to the moon, allowing the United States to establish their political superiority. An added benefit was preventing the threat of missile attacks from space, thus achieving both national defense and pride. It is important to consider that the space industry at this time was not profitable and merely a basis for establishing dominance via technological advancements and marvels. As of present day, space exploration is focused primarily on research and the collection of knowledge, and the promise of profitability has slowly been becoming more apparent. Yet to do so, significant investments into R&D must be made to allow for the creation of the technology needed to achieve profitability in space. Thus, spending on exploration has continued to increase, with just under $31 billion in budgetary resources awarded to NASA for 2023 in the United States, with a global government spending of $103 billion for dedicated space programming. The private industry has also begun funding projects more aggressively, as annual investment towards space-economy projects has grown from $300 million to over $10 billion dollars between 2012 and 2021."),
        ("i", "sp-1"),
        ("p", "Different forms of private involvement have long collaborated with NASA in the form of outsourced labour: NASA continuously contracts external agencies who have the capacities and expertise to actually construct their equipment. A prime example of this outsourcing is the long-standing partnership with Boeing as the prime contractor for the International Space Station in 1993, after working with the company and contracting their manufacturing capabilities for the Lunar Orbiters, or the Saturn V rockets used in the Apollo moon missions. The inflow of NASA funding and research further allowed Boeing to develop their own air and marine craft lines as well as prompting their own line of space-specific manufacturing capabilities, such as a satellite launching platform in the Pacific Ocean, or the current Starliner ship. Given this successful long-standing relationship, it's important to recognize the differences in structure and impact as new-age private space companies make their marks in the space industry."),

        ("p", "Privatization is beneficial for a myriad of reasons - generally, contributing to higher efficiency and faster, more focused advancement in research and practical application than when in the hands of more bureaucratic agencies. Private companies may only remain in business for as long as they bring results, and in the scientific field, the applications of medical instruments, for example, have been motivated by the inherent need to turn development into a profitable business model. This is mirrored in the space industry, for as long as companies are pouring funds into research, they intend for that research to have practical, marketable applications that they can use to gain a hefty return. Already, SpaceX’s profit motivated system has allowed for huge cost reductions - from $10,000 to $1,200 per pound of payload -in launch capabilities with the development of liquid fuels and recoverable spacecraft, and is how the primarily American body that supports ISS transfer missions replaced the Russian actors used for the past decade. Even in the past, partnerships between massive federal agencies and specialist private contractors resulted in higher efficiency and mutually beneficial advancement, as seen with Boeing. However, the independent growth of new age space enterprises fundamentally differs from the partnerships of the past, and are motivated by much narrower aspirations. Privatization creates an environment of proprietary, private information, and an increase in commoditized knowledge. This attitude hinders potential progress and works against the nature of scientific discovery. In an industry that was founded for the good of the people, and depends so heavily on intensive research expeditions, commoditized knowledge translates into patents, intellectual property licenses and overall obstacles to the sharing and transfer of information. As progress is made by individual researchers working below independent enterprises, there exists no incentive to share information - anything that the company releases can be capitalized upon and used by its competitors, which works directly against the interest of the company. This prevents the brightest minds from working together to solve problems and contribute to discoveries, instead creating false competition in which progress is slowed. This collaboration is not limited to space-specific applications; already NASA is responsible for over 2,000 spin-off developments from heat protectant jackets to material simulations that are used in mining and materials work. Without the publicly available and accessible research coming from the obligations of a federal agency, the loss of related creation decreases the current economic and scientific benefit of working with theoretical research. Furthermore, as much of scientific space advancement is resource and time intensive, firms aiming to safekeep their findings from other researchers result in a waste of resources in repeating and rebuilding the tools needed for discovery instead of sharing the cost for the greatest chance of success. Especially in space, where first-movers have the ultimate advantage, the privatisation of the industry leads to firms trying to maintain their competitive edge at the explicit expense of progress."),
        ("p", "Historically, not only was it scientists' aim to unlock the secrets of our universe, but also their responsibility to share these discoveries with the world (considering their funding came from their respective nation's resources). However, privatization results in the hoarding of discoveries and associated information, preventing knowledge from being shared with the public. Considering that one of the main areas of social progress is to increase the information available for free to the public, the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced the intention to make all federally funded research available to the public within a year of private publication just last year. Based on much of existing space research being sourced from NASA or other nationalized players, that information has been free for the public to use and has allowed further research. In a practical sense, barriers to the flow of information within the scientific world have definite drawbacks in advancement, but the same barriers pose threats to the ideological goals of ensuring that the knowledge we keep about the world around and above us belongs to humanity as a whole, and not just to those who have resources to wrangle it. Censorship is an example of these barriers, allowing only the most privileged people to have access to the most important or unique data. National space agencies are much more involved in public opinion than privately held enterprises are. NASA derives its budget from federally allocated funds, and consequently, it is accountable to the American government regarding its goals and allocations for those funds. It follows that the resulting missions, research, and discoveries are aligned with public interest. Private companies build their funding elsewhere, often from wealthy individuals or private equity and venture funds, so their interests sit squarely within how to build profit as rapidly as possible. Unfortunately, this motivator often leads to unsustainable practices on the social side of business. For example, in pursuit of making launch processes less expensive, SpaceX built their own launch site, called Starbase, in Texas. This base is used for both research, production and launch testing, allowing SpaceX to make huge progress in bringing down their launch and payload costs, which cannot be shared with other organizations as easily as if it were just a single agency. It has also led to  concerns regarding air pollution, noise pollution, water contamination and wildlife protection, with the company being cited on 75 different environmental factors to be adjusted before continuing with their program."),
        ("p", "This concern expands to more players as one considers the impact of more individual launch sites as well as the space junk being littered in low earth orbit- a challenge that currently has no solution. Profit-motivated enterprises often have these considerations on the back burner, leading to unrestricted and unregulated harm coming in tandem with technological progress. Especially in an industry as unregulated and unexplored as the space industry is currently, allowing private companies complete freedom over historically nationally managed resources which poses a threat to the protection of public interests."),

Concerns include the development of complex industries such as commercial tourism, deep space research, manufacturing in space, asteroid mining, etc. Other concerns surround the nature of profitability such as cost-cutting and the impact on safety in high-risk environments. On that note, a large amount of regulation is yet to be established and thus concerns regarding jurisdiction, legislation, and emphasis of exploration arise. "),
        ("s", "Conclusion"),
        ("p", "While it is indisputable that space holds huge potential for profitable opportunity in the development of the industry and infrastructure, as well as within the space-for-space and space-for-earth markets, the drawbacks of a privatized movement need to be recognized in order for the industry to grow most efficiently. It is in the interest of everyone - federal space agencies, private companies, as well as public benefit - for the space industry to advance effectively and efficiently, which may not be completely aligned with the natural goals of a completely privatized industry in such a new space. Unregulated privatization, while having explicit benefits to advancement, may not be what works best as of yet: the sharing of information and accountability of public institutions build the strongest foundations for what will eventually become a thriving stand-alone economy. Thus, while privatization may lead to the development of a flourishing space economy, their priorities in the long-run do not align with the interests of the public and hinder the expansion of our civilization here on Earth."),

Not only do Russia's oligarchs have superior influence over business and economics, but they also control a large part of the country's politics, media, and governance. New policies that they influence, directly or indirectly, allow for them to continue growing their wealth at a significant advantage over others. In 1996, prominent oligarchs Roman  Abramovich, Michail Khordorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, and Vladimir Potanin helped fund the re-election of Yeltsin (Russia's first president after Gorbachev) in exchange for favorable policies surrounding loan-for-share purchases, their predominant method of acquiring assets for cheap.

Putin granted Timchenko one of the first oil export licenses in 1991, which allowed him to co-found the oil company Gunvor in 2000. Gunvor grew to control 35% of the state's oil exports within the first few years of operation, however, until that point was still considered a “niche player” in the market due to mostly exporting Russian oil through Estonia. Gunvor's expansion really started to kick off at the tail end of the 2008 economic crisis.

Timchenko himself previously owned shares in and controlled numerous smaller companies, such as Waterway Petroleum and Clearlake Shipping, and the financial crisis allowed him to strengthen these positions as well. Timchenko's group took everything “virtually overnight”. Today, Gunvor is the fourth largest crude oil trader in the world and with Russia being the world's largest exporter of oil in 2021, they are in a favorable position to continue moving even higher.

The most notable of these was their construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge, a 12-mile bridge that connected Russia with its newly-annexed territory Crimea. This bridge had heavy logistical and political complications associated with it, evident by the circumstances it was built in, however Arkady Rotenburg's company happily did it, completing the bridge in 2018.

Rusal was (and still is) one of the world's leading aluminum production companies, and when he and his company counterparts were sanctioned, aluminum prices soared.

At the time, gas prices were near their all time high and the Dutch had a relatively strong ability to harvest oil through the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), which was jointly owned by Esso and Shell. The discovery of natural gas was believed to enable the Dutch economy to grow and prosper, which it appeared to do so through the 70s: the Dutch Guilder appreciated by 16.4% between 1971 and 1977, social security benefits made up over 23% of national income versus 16.5% in 1970, and regulations were put in place establishing minimum wages, employment standards and environmental standards. The discovery of natural gas seemed to pave a road to long-term prosperity for the region."),
        ("p","By 1977, 80% of government revenue came from the natural gas. Despite the positive outlook at the time, the country began to crumble from the inside out. Industrial production had not increased during the 70s and employment in the manufacturing industry, which was once Holland’s strongest industry, declined by 16%. Corporate investment fell nearly 15%, and the proportion of people that qualified for their long-term benefits program increased from 20% in 1965 to more than 60% in 1977. Their overreliance on natural gas exports led to a dollar so strong that Holland could not sell any other goods for a reasonable price. This interior collapse of a nation, despite a positive economic image, was coined as the term “Dutch Disease”."),

        ("p","At the time, Dutch Disease was believed to be caused by an overreliance on one export. However, in the time since, it appears as though many nations have found success by relying on a single export, while others have been destroyed by it. Though previously unavoidable and misunderstood, Dutch Disease plagues nations that rely solely on one export but is entirely avoidable through strong fiscal policy."),
        ("s","Modern Single-Export Nations"),
        ("p","Dutch disease introduced the concept that relying on a singular export has harmful repercussions. However, when we look at today’s economy, we see many successful and unsuccessful nations that were born out of single export reliance, with common trends arising from both sides. Oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE come to mind as nations that have been able to utilize the export they rely upon to prosper. Though diversification might be the obvious answer to their success, entering new industries is extremely challenging when a nation does not have strong leadership or direction. The leaders of these oil rich nations have chosen to do 3 main things: invest in a sovereign wealth fund, invest in strategic industries, and control their oil companies. "),
        ("p","Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment vehicles that are often funded by natural resources and are used by a nation to diversify their interests into different industries. Based on size, the UAE’s SWF is the 3rd largest, Saudi Arabia’s is the 6th largest and Qatar’s is the 9th largest globally. These SWFs invest into industries that the host country had not found success in, such as Qatar’s SWFs investments into sports and tech, or the UAE’s investments into technology and travel. This presents a unique way to avoid Dutch disease, as a nation's rising dollar affects their exports but not investments."),

It appears as though their main goal is to bring foreigners in and keep them there for various reasons. For wealthy businesspeople, this means giving large tax incentives to encourage the growth of tech and finance in the country. For poor migrant workers, this means cheap labor and infrastructure development. It's a way for these oil-rich countries to increase their economic complexity while not actually relying on exports, but rather being attractive destinations to visit or live in, and using their high dollar to earn greater revenue from these newcomers."),
        ("i","d-3"),
        ("p","The final piece of this puzzle is overall government control. If the government can control the oil companies and those who operate it, they can avoid issues from Dutch Disease that were akin to the nations overreliance on their oil workers. Currently, roughly half of the world's oil production comes from state-owned companies such as Sinopec, QatarEnergy, Emirates National Oil, Aramco and Kuwait Oil Company, which are all from Asia and the Middle East. This number is expected to grow over the next decade as they are entirely self-sustaining and can collaborate through OPEC: an organization made up of oil nations like Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others around the Middle East. Having a central power in charge of a country’s main oil company ensures decisive action and a greater ability to secure a strong workforce, while ensuring that oil profits suit the nations need. After all, the rulers get rich as the nation gets rich, so it is in their best interest for oil production to continue."),

        ("p","Banana Republics are South American nations that are reliant entirely on bananas for their economic expansion and became this way through foreign intervention. The rise of Banana Republics was mainly due to the United Fruit Company, who’s first operation in 1871 started by building a railroad through Guatemala and Honduras. After realizing that the project was not profitable and having been granted over 800,000 acres of land along the railroad, they decided to expand into banana production. With control of over 13% of the surrounding nations land mass and over 4000 workers by the 1930s, the United Fruit Company had a heavy influence over the government purely because of the profit they brought the nation. The ultimatum was simple: if the government does not comply with the United Fruit Company, they could leave the nation and deprive them of their most successful export. The most extreme case of government control came in December 1928, when the famous “Banana Massacre'' left an estimated 2000 workers dead after they were protesting their abhorrent living conditions while working in banana farms. The massacre was led out by the Columbian military who were pressured by the United Fruit Company to bring their labor back into work. The United Fruit Company had enough control of the country that they could coerce Colombian leadership to lead out a massacre on their own people, who were protesting the conditions that they were subjected to by a foreign company, just for the country to get a meager share of the profits."),

When large companies are state-owned, investment can be made to better the nation and prosper."),

The vast majority of their oil wells are owned by Shell, who “purchased” oil fields from the economy through shady-looking purchases that involved bribed government officials. Most notably, the $1.3B purchase  of OPL 245 led to $466M in the pockets of government officials. Today, the country is so reliant on the oil giant that 65% of their government revenue comes from oil. Though the relationship was initially symbiotic with Shell gaining new oil fields and Nigeria getting new infrastructure, foreign investment, labor opportunities and profits, Shell’s immense power was abused through massive oil spills (they admitted to around 250 oil spills per year from 1997-2006) and power consolidation. One of the most noteworthy acts is their devastation of Ogoniland, a 1000km  add delta that was poisoned with oil spills, which Shell paid $83M to fix despite the UNEP estimating that a $1B fund is needed to correct the environmental damage.

These countries were taken over by companies that demanded more power and destroyed their nations by making them reliant on the exports that earned them the most profit. Dutch Disease is strong in nations that have higher dollars and labor forces that are empowered by their reliance on one export, but it is also strong in nations where their other exports are destroyed by monopolization and their labor forces are suppressed by their own governments that act as puppets to foreign conglomerates."),

The same was seen in the 1970s when Great Britain found oil off the coast of Scotland and they fell in a recession despite oil prices quadrupling. However, we’ve seen nations such as the UAE and Qatar become net oil exporters while successful, and net exporters such as Nigeria and Banana Republics be unsuccessful. So what causes this difference?"),
        ("p","We’ve already established that the type of export has little influence on the country's success, with some oil nations finding success and some not. The UAE and Qatar were once poor countries with exports such as fishing and farming, but were able to transform into global superpowers. Nigeria is in a similar situation to pre-oil middle eastern countries, but are still finding it difficult to progress. The main success factors lie beyond the type of export."),
        ("p","The other main idea is the possibility of collaboration. The largest oil exporters are members of OPEC, which allows these countries to control global trade of oil by setting volume mandates. If a country like Nigeria could join OPEC, it could perhaps find more success by being able to collaborate with some of the other exporters. Banana Republics could form their own type of OPEC and control global banana exports, asserting how much volume can be distributed and controlling prices as a result. However, there is one large factor that prevents this from being possible that defines the main factor which separates successful and unsuccessful single export nations."),
        ("p","The success of single export nations is solely dependent on their foreign policy and level of government control. When a nation is able to learn from the lessons of Dutch Disease and quickly expand into new industries through an investment vehicle or government spending, they are able to benefit from their profits from any export that they might rely on. This is only possible with strong foreign policy, where spending is constantly monitored and trends are understood."),

        ("p","We spoke with an individual from the IMF who has studied the effects of foreign policy on the success of a nation. Through in-depth discussion and ideation, we learned that nations suffer when their economies are informal and their labor costs are too high, which pose as barriers to growth as the nation might try to create an entity to generate profit through successful exports. The defining factor between success and failure in the eyes of this individual was a country's economic framework. Countries need to control their exports, but their success is defined by much more than that: they also need to look at their education levels, their labor laws and their investments. The way forward for suffering nations is unclear, said this individual, but they must start by taking control of their resources and using their profits to encourage long term prosperity."),
        ("s","Conclusion"),
        ("p","It appears as though the goal of every single export nation is to diversify away from that export. This is seen globally through the Middle East's growth in tourism, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and even Canada’s own pension plans that were developed from their oil sands. Dutch Disease is a condition gained from being reliant on an export for too long, and these countries are trying their best to diversify as quickly as possible in order to avoid the condition. This is simply not possible when foreign companies obtain too much share of a nation's profits and prohibits them from expanding into new industries and rather forces them to stay entirely focused on the one export that brings them the most success for their bottom line. The solution is clear: control the profits and invest them in a way where the country can avoid over reliance."),

People were spending ~$100M per year on purchases within the world with some having well over $1M worth of virtual real estate holdings. The rationale for the Oculus acquisition was to make it applicable to more social gathering like what was mentioned above, a far cry from their initial value proposition of gaming. However, competition from the broader gaming segment like Sony’s VR headset which was made for Playstation and lackluster demand for online social gathering applications like mentioned above made it difficult for their products to gain any traction.

These tailwinds put Oculus at the forefront of their new envisioned future. In 2021, Facebook committed itself to this shift by changing the parent company name to Meta Platform. The shift was a big piece of news to take the heat off and put them in a new light. Google did the same thing in 2015 by restructuring themselves under a new parent company called Alphabet to differentiate its search engine from the multitude of other ventures it has underway. The Facebook name change is indicative of a fundamental shift towards their prioritization of the Metaverse within their business model. "),

The tracking came in the form of collecting user data on other websites to determine search patterns to help optimize targeted ads but Apple implemented an update in iOS 14 which forces the apps to ask permission in whether they would like to be tracked and people turning it off  created overall lower quality targeted ads. Zuckerberg publicly denounced the new policy implementation in a press release but mentioned that the company would be able to navigate the challenges due to their long-term investments. The company had been recently testing out a new application which was invite-only for a period in which users who had VR Headsets could collaborate with other users in practical manners (I.E. having virtual meeting rooms, whiteboards, etc.) and after some fine-tuning, the app known as Horizon Worlds was released to the public."),

With Instagram being the leading service provider among the two with the greatest amount of growth and composition of total revenue, this would leave the parent company in practically irresolvable turmoil without anything to fall back on.

To understand that better, it makes sense to define some of the market's current dynamics, how those are expected to evolve over time, and where Meta fits into that bigger picture. Within the Meta Platforms realm, the Metaverse can be defined as the cumulation of three big drivers; the AR/XR utilization, the 3D elements, and the infrastructure required to host successful metaverses.

User experiences are the biggest drivers of a successful 3D World and without it, capitalistic interests cannot be pursued.

Global regulatory organizations deal with these dilemmas differently, some on a continent-wide basis and some down to local levels, but the consensus is that if the ethical dilemmas aren’t considered seriously, irreversible damage can be done.

They could also continue developing partnerships among industry leaders and smaller players to get their foot into the doors of sub-niches they expect to grow and can serve through resource provision or through an acquisition. The issue with this is the amount of time it would take to acquire and integrate the company and realize synergies which would conflict with the count-down of their lawsuit with the FTC."),

        ("s","Introduction"),
        ("p","The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable power is one of the most talked about topics in today’s discourse, and for a good reason. The world is already experiencing the effects of climate change, whether it be through the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, or rising sea levels threatening the entire existence of several Pacific islands, or the increased difficulty of growing crops in increasingly hot and arid regions. Of course, where there is opportunity, there will be entrepreneurs who find a way to capitalize on it. One such entrepreneur who capitalized on the threat posed by climate change is Elon Musk, who helped fund Tesla at its early stages and eventually was appointed CEO after quite a bit of chaos amongst the rank and file of the company. Tesla started out as just an Electric Vehicle (EV) company, but their overall mission has always been to accelerate the advent of sustainable transportation, through their other business ventures, such as solar panels. This was made evident with their merger with SolarCity, operating charger stations, as well as the building of its battery storage capabilities. In general, Tesla has bucked the trend of most auto giants, who mostly outsource to contractors, by increasing its level of vertical integration to 80%, according to a Goldman Sachs analyst. While there have been integration challenges in this regard, the company continues to make progress in becoming a more integrated producer of electric vehicles."),
        ("p","Now, Tesla has done quite a bit to try to bring electric vehicle production in-house. They produce the batteries within their cars themselves, and have also inked offtake agreements with lithium producers, which allow them to have more or less a guaranteed flow of lithium for the years to come. However, there is significant potential for Tesla to take everything several steps further. As of now, Tesla’s main focus is mostly on cementing its place as one of the world’s pre-eminent electric vehicle producers. However, an electrified future relies more on bolstering the electric grid in its entirety, rather than just churning out electric vehicles en masse - this is one of the biggest challenges faced in the energy transition. As this article will show, Tesla can replicate its vertically integrated model to expand to the broader electrical infrastructure industry through its Tesla Energy segment, a space which presents a massive market opportunity for the company to scale up within."),
        ("s","The Declining Power Grid"),
        ("p","It’s no secret that America’s infrastructure is falling apart. According to the White House, public infrastructure spending relative to GDP has fallen by over 40% since the 1960s. Moreover, 20% of America’s roads and over 45,000 bridges are in disrepair. A large portion of America’s water supply still relies on dangerous and toxic lead pipes."),
        ("p","Many of these infrastructural concerns apply to the electric grid as well. The average lifespan of transmission lines is 50 years. Most of America’s transmission lines are over 40 years old, and according to Swiss Re, malfunctions tend to escalate during this time. As over 90% of America’s power grid relies on these transmission lines, our reliance on this system does not bode well for the future."),
        ("i","t-1"),
        ("p","However, this isn’t the worst of it. The data used by the operators of this infrastructure to make major decisions relies on past data which doesn’t factor in climate change, which means that the country’s electric grid isn’t equipped to tackle the challenges brought on by climate change. To make matters worse, as demand for electricity spikes due to the proliferation of electric vehicles, the grid has already shown weakness. A heatwave, which knocked out several power plants in Texas earlier this year, forced Texans to limit electricity from vital services, such as air conditioning. Similarly, California asked residents to stop charging their EVs due to climate conditions at the same time that the state was mulling EV adoption and instituting bans on internal combustion engine cars."),
        ("p","This situation further does not consider another issue laying between the intersection of electric vehicles and the power grid - what good are electric vehicles if the electricity used to charge them is produced from dirty energy? Despite growing interest in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, there remains the issue of intermittency. For example, wind power generates electricity mostly during the earliest and latest hours of the day. Due to poor renewable energy storage infrastructure across the world, this means that excess energy is generated during these times, when there is often less demand, and thus must be “dumped” for free. This limits the ability to actually scale renewable energy; however, large scale battery energy storage solutions offer a solution to this. That being said, actual penetration of BESS systems is quite low across the world, meaning there will need to be significant capital expenditure required on this front."),
        ("p","Clearly, for the energy transition to actually go through, there will need to be trillions of dollars spent refurbishing the country’s infrastructure. Currently, there is already a lot of infrastructure funding surrounding the power grid. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal outlines the government’s plans to invest more than $65 billion to upgrade our power infrastructure by building new transmission lines and the funding of new programs to support the development of clean energy technologies. In addition to this, this legislation will accelerate widespread adoption of electric vehicles through investing $7.5 billion to create a national network of EV chargers throughout America. This provides huge opportunities for companies with expertise in the area of electric power to obtain billions of dollars worth of contracts to upgrade America’s infrastructure, then accessing massive annuity-like contracts to maintain it. Tesla, by virtue of its vertically integrated nature encompassing power generation, power storage, and manufacturing the end products of EVs, is in a unique position to forge the partnerships needed to equip itself to fill this gap and cement a position for itself within the broader infrastructure space."),
        ("s","Tesla’s Expertise"),
        ("p","Tesla is highly knowledgeable in the electrical industry due to its subsidiary, Tesla Energy. Originally known as SolarCity, Tesla acquired the clean energy company in 2016, where they mainly focused on the sale of solar panels for homeowners. Tesla Energy has since launched three products: the Solar Roof, the Powerwall, and most recently, the Megapack. Functioning similar to traditional solar panels, the Solar Roof is essentially solar panels seamlessly integrated into roofs through combining glass solar tiles with steel roofing tiles. Tesla’s Powerwall is a battery storage solution that allows homeowners to store excess solar energy. Lastly, the Megapack is a similar energy storage product to the Powerwall, just on a larger scale for commercial projects. In fact, energy storage is something that Tesla has begun to hone in on more, with the company’s overall mission statement being “to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy”. In 2021, Tesla began building a production facility that will be able to produce 40 million kWh of energy storage per year in Austin, Texas. An average home in America uses 10,632 kWH of energy a year, meaning that this would be able to power 3762 houses."),
        ("i","t-2"),
        ("p","In addition to this expansion, Tesla reports that energy storage and solar panel deployment has grown 62% and 13% respectively in the third quarter of 2022. An emphasis on cross-selling solar power installations with the Powerwall and making products more widely available increased Tesla Energy revenues to $1.117 billion, a 38.6% year-over-year increase during the third quarter of 2022. These developments are crucial for Tesla in both solving key problems of tempermental power grids, and in expanding in the energy storage market."),
        ("p","Tesla has used their expertise in energy storage to offer timely support for the US in times of need. For example, in 2021 when Hurricane Ida hit the New Orleans area the power grid was shut down and became inoperable for several weeks. Tesla was able to provide power to over 1,000 people by deploying powerwalls and solar panel disaster relief systems. With proven capabilities in the electrical industry, Tesla can look to provide more long-term energy storage solutions to American consumers, and even more importantly, to renewable energy projects which can make use of Tesla’s capabilities in battery energy storage solutions. By storing excess energy instead of having to dispatch it, the economics on renewable energy development projects will increase, which incentivizes further construction of renewable capacity, which benefits the nation from an energy transition perspective, and the consequent demand for even more energy storage, which benefits Tesla. Currently in Texas, Tesla is piloting a service where selected Powerwall users can sell the energy generated from their solar panels back to the power grid. Furthermore, they have created their own utilities company, Tesla Energy Ventures and gained approval to set up a Virtual Power Plant in Texas. This is a method where Tesla can draw energy from all individual batteries to the grid which eliminates the need for natural gas fire beaker plants during periods of high energy demand. So far, these developments are promising indicators of Tesla’s ability to venture into sustainable energy storage for consumers all over the US."),
        ("s","The Critical Metals"),
        ("p","Now, further expansion into this space is easier said than done. If Tesla is to move into larger scale development of energy storage solutions and electric transmission infrastructure, this will mean that its cost structure will tilt towards relatively volatile commodity prices, such as copper. Tesla has already been working on hedging out its risks through offtakes and potentially outight acquisitions of lithium projects. However, the raw materials needed in this proposed transformation would be on a whole different level."),
        ("p","Some of the key metals needed in this scenario include copper, lithium, and nickel. These three all have quite interesting situations. Copper production is most concentrated within South America, the US, and Russia, with a relatively mature production profile. Lithium, on the other hand, is a bit more nascent in the sense that most production occurs in Australia or South America, but there are a massive flurry of development projects underway worldwide, including within the US and Canada. Nickel is another metal which has been receiving increased attention due to its importance in batteries and also within the wind industry - Indonesia is the dominant producer worldwide."),
        ("p","Acquiring battery metal mines is a strategic move that can help Tesla achieve more vertical integration and control over costs. By owning the mines, Tesla can secure a steady supply of critical components, reduce dependence on external suppliers, and increase control over the supply chain. In this section, we will take a look at four key battery metals: lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, and examine the potential benefits and costs of acquiring mines for Lithium is a crucial component in lithium-ion batteries, which are used in electric vehicles. As demand for electric vehicles continues to rise, the demand for lithium is also expected to increase significantly. Some of the main lithium mines are located in countries like Australia, Chile, and Argentina; however, there are an increasing number of lithium projects under development in both North America and Europe, which are closer to Tesla’s gigafactories in the US and Germany. Nickel is another important metal for battery production and is used in the cathode of lithium-ion batteries. Mines for nickel can be found in Canada, Russia, and Indonesia, among other nations. Due to the high concentration of production from more geopolitically volatile nations like Russia and Indonesia, it makes sense for Tesla to acquire mines and help finance their expansion to lock in supply. Finally, copper is used in the wiring of electric vehicles and is important for both battery production and broader electric infrastructure. Mines for copper can be found in countries such as Chile, Peru, and China. Therefore, by Tesla acquiring these battery metal mines, it will achieve vertical integration, have a steady supply of key components, and reduce dependence on external suppliers."),
        ("s","Conclusion"),
        ("p","Tesla has the potential to leverage its business model to expand to the broader electrical industry through placing bigger importance on its Tesla Energy segment. Tesla, unlike other electrical vehicle companies, has already expanded their operations in the electricity generating and storing industry through their solar panels and batteries. Furthermore, acquiring the  mines is a crucial part in furthering their expansions, as Tesla gains significant advantages in reducing the overall costs of production, and increased control over its products and services. Of course, there will be arguments that Tesla does not have the expertise to operate mines - while this is true, it is also mitigated by the fact that Tesla can just keep the same management in place and act as a more passive manager. There are several non-specialized global conglomerates with mining operations, such as Sumitomo, which sets a precedent that non-mining companies can own mines."),
        ("p","Using their expertise, access to valuable materials, and knowing the deteriorating power grid in America, Tesla has significant financial gain to make through forming partnerships to improve and create new infrastructure that will ultimately reduce Americans' reliance on the outdated and faulty power grid system. In conclusion, as the electrical industry continues to evolve with an emphasis on renewable energy supported by the government, and the popularization of electrical vehicles, Tesla is in the perfect position with their resources to be at the forefront of the future electrical industry."),
